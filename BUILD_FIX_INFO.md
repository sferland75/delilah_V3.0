# Build Fix Information

## Issue Resolved
Conflicting app and page files were causing the app to fail to compile. The Pages Router (`/src/pages`) and App Router (`/src/app`) components were attempting to handle the same routes.

## Files Removed
The following files were moved to a backup directory (`/src/pages_backup/`) and removed from the Pages Router to resolve the conflicts:

1. `src\pages\index.tsx`
2. `src\pages\import\assessment.tsx`
3. `src\pages\report-drafting\index.tsx`

## Migration Note
We are moving toward using the App Router architecture (`/src/app/`) as it's the newer Next.js pattern with more features, including built-in layouts, server components, and improved routing.

## Accessing the Original Files
If needed, the original files are preserved in the `/src/pages_backup/` directory:
- `src\pages_backup\index.tsx`
- `src\pages_backup\import\assessment.tsx`
- `src\pages_backup\report-drafting\index.tsx`

## Next Steps
Continue development using the App Router architecture. All new routes should be created in the `/src/app` directory following the routing conventions:
- `app/page.tsx` - Main landing page
- `app/route-name/page.tsx` - Specific route pages
- `app/route-name/layout.tsx` - Layouts for specific routes
