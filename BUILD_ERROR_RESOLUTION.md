# Build Error Resolution

## Issue
The application was failing to compile due to a conflict between Babel and the Next.js font optimization system.

Error: `"next/font" requires SWC although Babel is being used due to a custom babel config being present.`

## Solution Implemented
1. **Removed Next.js Font System**:
   - Removed `next/font` imports from `layout.tsx`
   - Used standard CSS-based web font solution instead

2. **Added Web Font Import**:
   - Added Google Fonts import for Inter font in `globals.css`
   - Added CSS variables for font stack
   - Used these variables to maintain the same font appearance

## Explanation
Your project is using Babel due to custom babel configuration files (`.babelrc` and `babel.config.js`). Next.js's font system requires the SWC compiler, which conflicts with Babel.

Since you likely need the Babel configuration for existing code, we chose to remove the Next.js font system rather than attempt a full migration to SWC. This is the least disruptive approach.

## Future Options

1. **Complete Migration to App Router with SWC**:
   - Remove all Pages Router (`/pages`) code
   - Remove Babel configuration entirely
   - Re-enable Next.js font optimization
   - This would require a more significant refactoring

2. **Stick with Babel**:
   - Continue using standard web fonts as implemented
   - Keep your existing Babel configuration
   - This may limit access to some newer Next.js features
