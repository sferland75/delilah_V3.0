# Delilah V3.0 Pages Router Restoration

## Overview

This document outlines the process of restoring the Delilah V3.0 application to use only the Pages Router, reverting the attempt to migrate to the App Router that caused critical routing failures.

## Background

The application was originally built using Next.js Pages Router, which was working correctly. An attempt was made to migrate to the App Router, but this resulted in both routing systems being active simultaneously, causing redirect loops and 404 errors.

## Changes Implemented (March 3, 2025)

1. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Updated `next.config.js` to explicitly disable App Router using `experimental: { appDir: false }`
   - Maintained necessary webpack configuration for PDF.js compatibility

2. **App Router Removal**
   - Ensured the `src/app` directory remained renamed to `src/app_disabled_final`
   - Created a script `complete-pages-router-restoration.bat` to automate the cleanup process

3. **Middleware Cleanup**
   - Identified and removed any middleware that might be causing redirects between routing systems
   - Backed up any removed files for future reference

4. **Cache Clearing**
   - Cleared Next.js cache to ensure a clean state

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified
- `next.config.js` - Updated to explicitly disable App Router
- Created `complete-pages-router-restoration.bat` - Script to automate cleanup

### Key Directories
- `src/pages` - Contains all the application routes (Pages Router)
- `src/app_disabled_final` - Disabled App Router directory

## Future Considerations

1. **Migration Strategy**
   - If migration to App Router is desired in the future, plan for a complete migration rather than attempting to use both routing systems simultaneously
   - Create a separate branch for testing the migration before merging to main

2. **Documentation**
   - Update development documentation to clearly indicate that the application uses Pages Router
   - Document the routing structure to help onboard new developers

3. **Testing**
   - Implement comprehensive tests for all routes to catch routing issues early
