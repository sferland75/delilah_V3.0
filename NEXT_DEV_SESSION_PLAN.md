# Next Development Session Plan - Delilah V3.0

## Priority Tasks

1. **Complete App Router Removal**
   - Use administrative privileges to rename `src/app` directory to `src/app_disabled_complete`
   - Make sure this is done while the Next.js server is not running

2. **Configuration Cleanup**
   - Update `next.config.js` with `appDir: false` in experimental options
   - Ensure no references to App Router files remain in configuration

3. **Browser Cache Clearing**
   - Completely clear browser cache for localhost:3000
   - Test in incognito/private window to avoid any persistent cache issues

4. **Comprehensive Redirect Review**
   - Audit all redirects in the Pages Router
   - Check all page components for hard-coded redirects
   - Review and potentially refactor the page navigation flow

5. **Testing Key Workflows**
   - Test PDF import functionality thoroughly
   - Ensure all assessment sections load properly
   - Verify report generation works as expected

## Approach for Complete Fix

The most promising approach for a complete fix involves:

1. **Single Routing Paradigm**
   - Commit fully to Pages Router (more stable with current setup)
   - Remove all App Router code and configuration
   - Ensure no hybrid routing patterns remain

2. **Simplify Architecture**
   - Review and simplify page structure
   - Consider implementing a clear page hierarchy
   - Document the routing flow for future maintenance

3. **Clean Build Process**
   - Start with a clean Next.js cache
   - Rebuild the application without any App Router components
   - Ensure all imported modules are compatible with Pages Router

## Temporary Workarounds (If Complete Fix Fails)

If issues persist during the next development session:

1. **Standalone PDF Import App**
   - Continue using `D:\delilah-pdf-import` for essential functionality
   - Consider expanding this standalone app with additional features if needed

2. **Manual Navigation**
   - Keep the manual landing page for App Router root
   - Use this as a bridge between routers if conflicts cannot be fully resolved

3. **Static Export**
   - Consider using Next.js static export mode
   - This would eliminate server-side routing complications

## Important Files to Review

| File Path | Purpose | Review Recommendations |
|-----------|---------|------------------------|
| `next.config.js` | Main configuration | Check for any remaining App Router settings |
| `src/pages/_app.js` | Main application wrapper | Verify routing and context handling |
| `src/pages/index.tsx` | Home page | Ensure navigation links are correct |
| `src/components/navbar.js` | Navigation | Check for hard-coded paths |
| `package.json` | Dependencies | Review Next.js version and compatibility |

## Reference Documentation

See these files for detailed information:

1. `ROUTING_FIX_PROGRESS.md` - Current status and identified issues
2. `ROUTING_FIX_COMMANDS.md` - Commands and code used in fix attempts
3. `docs/LOADING_ISSUE_STATUS.md` - Original issue documentation
4. `docs/PDF_IMPORT_STANDALONE_SOLUTION.md` - Standalone app details

## Success Criteria

The fix will be considered successful when:
- The application starts without compile errors
- The browser can load localhost:3000 without redirect loops
- All main features (PDF import, assessments, reports) function correctly
- Navigation between pages works consistently
