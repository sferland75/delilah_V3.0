### 4. Clinical Decision Support Validation

#### Decision Support Risk Management
- [ ] Intelligence features must be clearly distinguishable from clinician judgment
- [ ] System must not override clinical decision-making
- [ ] Suggestions must be based on established clinical guidelines where applicable
- [ ] System must clearly communicate the basis for suggestions

#### Testing Methodology:
1. Assess how OTs interpret and use intelligence suggestions
2. Validate that suggestions are presented as aids, not directives
3. Trace sample suggestions to their underlying rules or patterns
4. Verify that clinicians can easily override or ignore suggestions

#### Risk Assessment Matrix:

| Feature | Risk Level | Mitigation Strategy | Validation Method |
|---------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Contextual suggestions | Medium | Clearly mark as suggestions | User interpretation testing |
| Data validation warnings | Low | Provide clear reasoning | Technical verification |
| Content improvements | Low | Present as optional | User acceptance testing |
| Completeness indicators | Low | Objective metrics | Technical verification |
| Terminology consistency | Low | Present alternatives | User preference testing |

#### Stakeholder Questions:
- "Do you feel the intelligence features support or attempt to replace your clinical judgment?"
- "How confident are you in the accuracy of the system's suggestions?"
- "Is it clear why the system is making specific recommendations?"

## Validation Documentation Requirements

For each regulatory requirement, the following documentation must be generated during testing:

1. **Test Evidence**
   - Screenshots/recordings demonstrating compliance
   - Tester notes and observations
   - User feedback specific to compliance aspects

2. **Compliance Assessment**
   - Requirement traceability matrix
   - Pass/fail status for each requirement
   - Remediation plan for any failed requirements

3. **Expert Review**
   - Sign-off from relevant subject matter experts:
     - Privacy officer
     - Compliance specialist
     - Accessibility expert
     - Clinical specialist

## Validation Test Case Examples

### Test Case 1: Privacy Compliance in Contextual Suggestions

**Objective**: Verify that contextual suggestions do not expose PHI or create privacy risks

**Steps**:
1. Create a test assessment with sensitive patient information
2. Navigate through all sections generating contextual suggestions
3. Review all suggestions for PHI exposure
4. Examine system logs for sensitive data handling

**Expected Results**:
- No PHI appears in suggestions
- Suggestions reference data types, not specific values
- System logs do not contain unencrypted PHI

### Test Case 2: Documentation Standard Compliance

**Objective**: Verify that intelligence features promote compliance with AOTA standards

**Steps**:
1. Complete a full assessment using intelligence features
2. Generate a final report
3. Have a compliance expert review against AOTA documentation checklist
4. Compare with reports created without intelligence features

**Expected Results**:
- Intelligence-assisted reports meet or exceed AOTA standards
- Required elements are properly flagged by completeness indicators
- Terminology is consistent with professional standards

### Test Case 3: Accessibility of Intelligence Features

**Objective**: Verify that intelligence features are accessible to all users

**Steps**:
1. Navigate the system using only keyboard
2. Enable screen reader and access all intelligence features
3. Test with color contrast analyzer
4. Verify all interactive elements meet size requirements

**Expected Results**:
- All features accessible via keyboard
- Screen reader correctly announces suggestions and warnings
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards
- Interactive elements meet minimum size requirements

### Test Case 4: Clinical Decision Support Boundaries

**Objective**: Verify that intelligence features support but do not replace clinical judgment

**Steps**:
1. Present contradictory clinical information in the assessment
2. Note how intelligence features respond
3. Attempt to complete assessment against system recommendations
4. Survey testers on perceived authority of suggestions

**Expected Results**:
- System identifies contradictions but doesn't force resolution
- OTs can complete assessment against suggestions if clinically justified
- OTs perceive suggestions as aids, not directives
- System provides reasoning for suggestions
