# Developer Next Steps for Delilah V3.0

## Priority Issues (March 4, 2025)

The following issues require immediate attention in order of priority:

### 1. UI State Management Fix

**Problem:** The application suffers from UI state synchronization issues, particularly with client names not updating in the header after saving and form data not persisting properly between tab navigation.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Review the comprehensive analysis in `PERSISTENT_UI_ISSUES.md`
- Implement a global state management solution (Redux, Zustand, or Jotai recommended)
- Replace the current Context API implementation with a more robust solution
- Add proper state persistence with loading indicators

**Files to Focus On:**
- `src/contexts/AssessmentContext.tsx`
- `pages/full-assessment.tsx`
- `src/sections/1-InitialAssessment/components/Demographics.tsx`
- `src/services/assessment-storage-service.ts`

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

### 2. Form Data Persistence

**Problem:** Form data is lost when navigating between sections, even though it appears to be saved correctly.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Update the form handling to use the react-hook-form persist plugin or similar technology
- Add automatic save on blur functionality for all form fields
- Implement a more robust form validation system with visible feedback
- Add data recovery mechanisms for unsaved changes

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

### 3. Complete Assessment Workflow Finalization

**Problem:** Several assessment sections still have basic implementation issues, and transitions between sections could be smoother.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Test and ensure all form sections save data correctly
- Add proper validation to all form sections
- Implement consistent navigation between form sections
- Add progress tracking and completion indicators

**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 days

### 4. Performance Optimization

**Problem:** The application experiences noticeable lag when saving data or navigating between sections.

**Recommended Actions:**
- Implement proper code splitting for each assessment section
- Optimize localStorage operations with batching
- Consider implementing a worker thread for heavy operations
- Add performance monitoring

**Estimated Effort:** 2-3 days

## Backend Integration Path

Once the core UI and state management issues are resolved, the following backend integration steps are recommended:

1. Replace localStorage with proper API endpoints
2. Implement user authentication and authorization
3. Add proper data synchronization with offline support
4. Implement real-time collaboration features

## Testing Recommendations

For the next development cycle, focus testing efforts on:

1. **End-to-End Testing:** Add comprehensive Cypress tests for the entire assessment workflow
2. **Unit Tests:** Add unit tests for all core data operations
3. **Performance Testing:** Benchmark the application performance with large datasets
4. **Cross-Browser Testing:** Ensure compatibility across major browsers

## Documentation

The following documentation updates are needed:

1. Update component documentation with state management patterns
2. Create a comprehensive data flow diagram
3. Document form validation rules and error messages
4. Create user guides for each assessment section

## Conclusion

The application has good foundational structure but requires significant refactoring of its state management approach. The priority should be to stabilize the core functionality first, then proceed with feature enhancements. A comprehensive rewrite of the state management layer is recommended rather than incremental patches to the existing implementation.
