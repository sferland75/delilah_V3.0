# Edit Tracking System Demo

## Overview
This demo showcases the Edit Tracking System implemented for Delilah V3.0, allowing users to track changes to report content, manage versions, and view edit history.

## Running the Demo

1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/edit-tracking-demo
   ```

## Demo Features

The demo page showcases the following features of the Edit Tracking System:

### 1. Content Editing
- Edit any section by clicking the "Edit" button that appears when you hover over content
- Make changes to the content in the editor
- Add optional comments to describe your changes
- Save changes to track them in the history

### 2. Version Management
- Create new versions to establish checkpoints in your editing process
- Add comments to versions to describe major changes
- Mark versions as "Published" when they're ready for distribution
- Revert to previous versions when needed

### 3. Edit History
- View the complete history of edits for each section
- See who made each change and when
- Compare changes with inline highlighting showing added/removed content
- View the content before and after each edit

### 4. Persistence
- All changes are persisted to local storage (for demo purposes)
- In a production environment, these would be saved to a database

## Integration with Report Drafting

The Edit Tracking System is designed to be integrated with the Report Drafting module:

1. Open the Report Drafting page:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/report-drafting
   ```

2. The "Preview & Edit" step includes an alternative implementation that integrates the Edit Tracking System
   - This is implemented in `ReportPreviewWithTracking.tsx`
   - Note: This is not yet connected to the main UI as it's a demonstration of the integration

## Implementation Details

The Edit Tracking System consists of:

### 1. Core Components
- `EditTrackingProvider`: Context provider that manages the state
- `TrackedContentEditor`: Editor that automatically tracks changes
- `EditHistoryPanel`: Panel for displaying edit history
- `VersionHistoryList`: Component for displaying versions
- `EditHistoryList`: Component for displaying edits with diff visualization
- `CreateVersionDialog`: Dialog for creating new versions

### 2. Services & Utilities
- `EditTrackingService`: Service for persisting changes
- Diff visualization utilities
- Format helpers for dates and text

### 3. Integration Components
- `ReportEditingExample`: Example integration for demonstration
- `ReportPreviewWithTracking`: Integration with Report Drafting module

## Next Steps

The Edit Tracking System is ready for full integration with the Report Drafting module. To complete the integration:

1. Replace the `ReportPreview` component with `ReportPreviewWithTracking` in `/src/app/report-drafting/page.tsx`
2. Update the `updateReportSection` function in the Report Drafting context to use the Edit Tracking System
3. Add version management functionality to the Export step
