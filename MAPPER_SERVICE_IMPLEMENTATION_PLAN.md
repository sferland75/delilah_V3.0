# Mapper Service Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for extending the Mapper Service Pattern to all remaining sections in the Delilah V3.0 application. The pattern has been successfully implemented for Medical History and Symptoms Assessment sections, resolving data mapping issues and improving performance.

## Implementation Timeline

|---------|----------|-----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Functional Status | High | Medium | None | Feb 28, 2025 |
| Typical Day | High | Medium | None | Feb 28, 2025 |
| Environmental Assessment | Medium | High | None | Mar 1, 2025 |
| Activities of Daily Living | Medium | High | None | Mar 1, 2025 |
| Attendant Care | Low | Medium | None | Mar 2, 2025 |
| Initial Assessment | Low | Low | None | Mar 2, 2025 |
| Purpose & Methodology | Low | Low | None | Mar 3, 2025 |

## Implementation Steps For Each Section

### 1. Analysis and Preparation

1. **Analyze Current Implementation**
   - Review the existing component and its data flow
   - Identify potential performance or error-handling issues
   - Document the current data structures (context and form)

2. **Identify Mapping Requirements**
   - Determine the transformations needed between context and form
   - Identify any complex mappings or edge cases
   - Note any current error-handling gaps

### 2. Create Mapper Service

1. **Create Service File**
   - Create a new file in the `services` directory (e.g., `functionalStatusMapper.ts`)
   - Include standard imports and interfaces/types

2. **Implement Default Values**
   - Export default values that match the form structure
   - Ensure all fields are properly initialized

3. **Implement Context → Form Mapping**
   - Create the `mapContextToForm` function
   - Add comprehensive error handling
   - Implement detailed logging
   - Handle all required data transformations

4. **Implement Form → Context Mapping**
   - Create the `mapFormToContext` function
   - Ensure data integrity is maintained
   - Add appropriate validation and error handling

5. **Add JSON Import/Export**
   - Implement `exportToJson` and `importFromJson` functions
   - Add error handling for these operations

### 3. Update Component

1. **Modify Component to Use Mapper**
   - Import the mapper service
   - Update the useForm hook to use the mapper's default values
   - Replace inline mapping logic with calls to mapper functions

2. **Implement JSON Export/Import UI**
   - Add export and import buttons
   - Implement handlers for file operations
   - Add success/error feedback for users

3. **Optimize Component Performance**
   - Remove any state updates during render
   - Ensure proper useEffect dependency arrays
   - Add proper memoization where needed

### 4. Testing

1. **Create Mapper Service Tests**
   - Test bidirectional mapping with various data scenarios
   - Test error handling with malformed data
   - Test JSON import/export functionality

2. **Update Component Tests**
   - Ensure component tests work with the new mapper
   - Test performance improvements
   - Verify UI behavior with various data conditions

### 5. Documentation

1. **Update Section Documentation**
   - Document the mapper implementation
   - Note any special handling or edge cases
   - Add examples of typical data transformations

2. **Update Next Developer Guide**
   - Mark the section as completed
   - Note the mapper implementation
   - Update test status

## Integration Testing

After implementing mappers for each section, conduct integration testing to ensure:

1. Data flows correctly between all sections
2. Context state remains consistent
3. Import/export functionality works across sections
4. Edge cases and error handling work as expected

## Success Criteria

A successful implementation of the mapper service for each section should achieve:

1. **Improved Performance**
   - No "Too many re-renders" errors
   - Smooth loading of data from context
   - Efficient updates to the context

2. **Enhanced Data Integrity**
   - Data maintains its structure through transformations
   - No data loss during mapping operations
   - Proper handling of empty or malformed data

3. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-documented mapping operations
   - Consistent pattern across sections

4. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Clearer feedback on data loading
   - Ability to import/export section data
   - Reliable data persistence

## Resources Required

1. **Developer Time**
   - 1-2 days per high-complexity section
   - 0.5-1 day per medium-complexity section
   - 0.25-0.5 day per low-complexity section

2. **Testing Support**
   - Unit testing framework
   - Sample data sets for each section
   - Performance testing tools

3. **Documentation**
   - Update to developer guides
   - Examples of mapper implementations
   - Section-specific mapping considerations

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complex data structures requiring extensive mapping | High | Medium | Break down complex mappings into smaller, reusable functions |
| Performance issues with large data sets | Medium | Low | Implement memoization and optimize mapping functions |
| Inconsistencies between mapper implementations | Medium | Medium | Create and follow a standard template for all mappers |
| Lack of test coverage | High | Low | Prioritize comprehensive testing for each mapper |
| Breaking changes to context data structure | High | Low | Version context schemas and ensure backward compatibility |

## Conclusion

The implementation of mapper services across all sections will significantly improve the Delilah V3.0 application's reliability, maintainability, and performance. By following this structured approach, we can ensure consistency across the codebase and a better experience for both developers and end users.

After completion, all sections will benefit from:
- Clear separation of data transformation and UI concerns
- Robust error handling and data validation
- Support for testing through JSON import/export
- Consistent implementation patterns
- Enhanced performance through optimized state management
