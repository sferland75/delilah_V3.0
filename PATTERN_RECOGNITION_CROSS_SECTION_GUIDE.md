# Pattern Recognition Cross-Section Integration Guide

## Introduction

Cross-section integration is a critical aspect of advanced pattern recognition in Delilah V3.0. This feature enables information detected in one section to inform or enhance the extraction and validation of data in other sections. This document provides detailed guidance on the implementation, current status, and best practices for cross-section integration.

## Architectural Overview

Cross-section integration operates through several key components:

### 1. Pattern Recognition Framework

- **PatternMatcher.js**: Central component that detects sections and routes extraction to specialized extractors
- **BaseExtractor.js**: Parent class for all extractors that provides common functionality
- **[SECTION]Extractor.js**: Specialized extractors for each section type (e.g., MEDICAL_HISTORY, SYMPTOMS)
- **ExtractorFactory.js**: Factory that creates and coordinates extractors for processing

### 2. Cross-Section Components

- **referralIntegration.ts**: Manages integration between referral data and other sections
- **CrossSectionValidator.js**: Validates data across sections for consistency and completeness
- **CrossSectionEnhancer.js**: Improves extraction in one section based on data from other sections

### 3. Data Flow Coordinators

- **AssessmentContext.js**: Maintains a global view of extracted assessment data
- **CrossSectionCoordinator.js**: Coordinates data sharing between section extractors
- **ExtractionManager.js**: Manages the overall extraction pipeline with cross-section awareness

## Cross-Section Integration Strategies

The system employs several strategies for cross-section integration:

### 1. Reference Propagation

Information from one section is referenced by extractors processing other sections to improve pattern matching.

```javascript
// Example: Using demographics data to enhance medical history extraction
function extractMedicalHistory(text, allSections) {
  const demographicsData = allSections['DEMOGRAPHICS'] || {};
  const clientName = demographicsData.clientName || '';
  
  // Use client name to improve medical history extraction
  if (clientName) {
    const patientHistoryPattern = new RegExp(`${clientName}\\s+(?:has|had|exhibits|reports)\\s+(.+?)(?:\\.|\n)`);
    // ...extraction continues
  }
}
```

### 2. Confidence Enhancement

Confidence scores for extracted data are adjusted based on corroborating evidence from other sections.

```javascript
// Example: Enhancing confidence when data is confirmed across sections
function enhanceConfidence(extractedData, allSections) {
  // Check if injury date in medical history matches date of loss in demographics
  if (allSections['DEMOGRAPHICS'] && 
      allSections['MEDICAL_HISTORY'] && 
      allSections['DEMOGRAPHICS'].dateOfLoss === allSections['MEDICAL_HISTORY'].injuryDate) {
    
    // Enhance confidence in both fields
    extractedData.confidence *= 1.2; // 20% boost
    extractedData.crossValidated = true;
  }
}
```

### 3. Context-Aware Extraction

Extractors use contextual information from other sections to guide their pattern recognition.

```javascript
// Example: Using symptoms to guide functional status extraction
function extractFunctionalStatus(text, allSections) {
  const symptomsData = allSections['SYMPTOMS'] || {};
  const painAreas = symptomsData.painAreas || [];
  
  // For each pain area, look for related functional limitations
  painAreas.forEach(area => {
    const functionalPattern = new RegExp(`(?:limited|restricted|impaired)\\s+(?:movement|function|range of motion)\\s+(?:of|in)\\s+(?:the|their)\\s+${area}`);
    // ...continue with extraction
  });
}
```

## Common Integration Scenarios

### Demographics ↔ Medical History

```javascript
// Demographics provides client name, date of birth, date of loss
// Medical History references this information for pattern recognition:

// 1. Use client name to identify medical history sections
// 2. Use date of loss as reference point for timeline events
// 3. Use date of birth to calculate age-appropriate conditions
```

### Symptoms ↔ Functional Status

```javascript
// Symptoms section describes pain, limitations, conditions
// Functional Status uses this information to:

// 1. Target functional assessments to affected body parts
// 2. Correlate symptom severity with functional limitations
// 3. Identify inconsistencies between reported symptoms and function
```

### Environmental ↔ ADLs

```javascript
// Environmental section describes home layout, accessibility
// ADLs section uses this information to:

// 1. Contextualize ADL performance based on environmental constraints
// 2. Identify potential barriers to independence
// 3. Validate ADL reports against environmental realities
```

### Typical Day ↔ Attendant Care

```javascript
// Typical Day section describes daily routine and activities
// Attendant Care section uses this information to:

// 1. Quantify assistance needed for specific activities
// 2. Identify time periods requiring more support
// 3. Validate care recommendations against actual daily patterns
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Adding New Cross-Section References

To add new cross-section references:

1. Identify data dependencies between sections
2. Update the relevant extractor to accept `allSections` parameter
3. Add logic to utilize data from other sections
4. Implement confidence adjustment based on cross-validation
5. Add error handling for missing cross-section data

Example:

```javascript
class FUNCTIONALSTATUSExtractor extends BaseExtractor {
  constructor() {
    super('FUNCTIONAL_STATUS');
    // Section-specific initialization
  }
  
  extract(text, allSections = {}) {
    // Get base extraction results
    const result = super.extract(text);
    
    // Enhance with cross-section data
    this.enhanceWithSymptomsData(result, allSections.SYMPTOMS);
    this.enhanceWithMedicalHistory(result, allSections.MEDICAL_HISTORY);
    
    return result;
  }
  
  enhanceWithSymptomsData(result, symptomsData) {
    if (!symptomsData) return;
    
    // Implementation details...
  }
  
  enhanceWithMedicalHistory(result, medicalHistory) {
    if (!medicalHistory) return;
    
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

### 2. Cross-Section Validation

For validating data across sections:

1. Define validation rules between related sections
2. Implement validation functions in `CrossSectionValidator.js`
3. Add confidence adjustments based on validation results
4. Provide feedback to users about potential inconsistencies
5. Log validation results for pattern improvement

Example:

```javascript
function validateAcrossSections(extractedData) {
  const validationIssues = [];
  
  // Check date consistency
  if (extractedData.DEMOGRAPHICS && extractedData.MEDICAL_HISTORY) {
    const lossDate = new Date(extractedData.DEMOGRAPHICS.dateOfLoss);
    const injuryDate = new Date(extractedData.MEDICAL_HISTORY.injuryDate);
    
    // Check if dates differ by more than one day
    const dayDiff = Math.abs((lossDate - injuryDate) / (24 * 60 * 60 * 1000));
    if (dayDiff > 1) {
      validationIssues.push({
        type: 'DATE_INCONSISTENCY',
        fields: ['DEMOGRAPHICS.dateOfLoss', 'MEDICAL_HISTORY.injuryDate'],
        message: 'Date of loss and injury date differ significantly'
      });
    }
  }
  
  // Add more validation checks...
  
  return validationIssues;
}
```

### 3. Confidence Adjustments

For adjusting confidence scores:

1. Define confidence adjustment rules in `ReferralConfidenceScorer.js`
2. Implement rule-based or statistical adjustment methods
3. Create methods for cross-field validation
4. Add metadata about confidence adjustment reasons
5. Log confidence adjustments for analysis

Example:

```javascript
function adjustConfidenceScore(extractedData) {
  // Apply cross-validation adjustments
  applyCrossValidation(extractedData);
  
  // Apply consistency checks
  applyConsistencyRules(extractedData);
  
  // Apply statistical adjustments
  applyStatisticalAdjustments(extractedData);
  
  // Log final confidence scores
  logConfidenceMetrics(extractedData);
  
  return extractedData;
}
```

## Testing Cross-Section Integration

### Unit Testing

1. Create mock data for each section
2. Test cross-section enhancement in isolation
3. Verify confidence adjustments
4. Test validation rules
5. Check cross-section references

Example:

```javascript
test('enhances functional status with symptoms data', () => {
  // Mock data
  const functionalText = '...functional status text...';
  const allSections = {
    SYMPTOMS: {
      painAreas: ['lower back', 'right knee'],
      intensityRatings: { 'lower back': 7, 'right knee': 5 }
    }
  };
  
  // Extract with cross-section data
  const extractor = new FUNCTIONALSTATUSExtractor();
  const result = extractor.extract(functionalText, allSections);
  
  // Verify enhancement
  expect(result.mobilityLimitations).toContain('lower back');
  expect(result.mobilityLimitations).toContain('right knee');
  expect(result.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.7);
});
```

### Integration Testing

1. Create comprehensive test documents
2. Process entire documents through the extraction pipeline
3. Verify cross-section enhancements
4. Check confidence scores
5. Validate cross-section relationships

Example:

```javascript
test('processes full document with cross-section integration', () => {
  // Full document text
  const fullDocumentText = fs.readFileSync('test-document.txt', 'utf8');
  
  // Process document
  const patternMatcher = new PatternMatcher();
  const sections = patternMatcher.detectSections(fullDocumentText);
  const extractionResults = ExtractorFactory.extractAllSections(sections);
  
  // Verify demographics → medical history integration
  expect(extractionResults.MEDICAL_HISTORY.clientName)
    .toBe(extractionResults.DEMOGRAPHICS.clientName);
    
  // Verify symptoms → functional status integration
  const symptomsAreas = extractionResults.SYMPTOMS.painAreas || [];
  const functionAreas = extractionResults.FUNCTIONAL_STATUS.affectedAreas || [];
  
  // Check if at least 50% of symptom areas are reflected in functional status
  const commonAreas = symptomsAreas.filter(area => 
    functionAreas.some(fArea => fArea.includes(area))
  );
  
  expect(commonAreas.length / symptomsAreas.length).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(0.5);
});
```
