# Import Path Fix Documentation

## Issue Description

The Delilah V3.0 application was experiencing component loading errors in the form UI due to incorrect import paths. The specific error pattern was:

```
Error loading component from @/sections/X-SectionName: Error: Cannot find module '@/sections/X-SectionName'
```

This was occurring because the require paths in the Pages Router mode of Next.js were not resolving the imports correctly. The `@/` alias wasn't working as expected with the dynamic imports we were using.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Modified Import Paths

Changed the import patterns from:
```javascript
// This wasn't working
const component = require('@/sections/4-SymptomsAssessment')...
```

To:
```javascript
// This works - using relative paths
const component = require('../sections/4-SymptomsAssessment')...
```

### 2. Simplified Component Loading

- Removed the dynamic component loading approach which was causing issues
- Used direct imports with proper error handling
- Added fallback components for each section in case loading failed

### 3. Created Individual Section Pages

To ensure users can access each form section correctly, we created standalone pages for each key section:

- `/emergency-symptoms` - For the Symptoms Assessment form
- `/medical-history` - For the Medical History form
- `/typical-day` - For the Typical Day form
- `/full-assessment` - A tabbed interface with all three forms

### 4. Error Handling Improvements

- Added clear error messages and fallback UI
- Implemented proper error boundaries around component loading
- Added success messages when components load correctly

## Implementation Details

The key fix was switching from the alias-based imports to relative path imports, which work more reliably in the Pages Router pattern. This fixed all the component loading issues.

### Example Fix:

```javascript
// Before (not working)
const SymptomsComponent = require('@/sections/4-SymptomsAssessment/components/SymptomsAssessment.integrated.final.tsx').SymptomsAssessmentIntegratedFinal;

// After (working)
const SymptomsComponent = require('../sections/4-SymptomsAssessment/components/SymptomsAssessment.integrated.final.tsx').SymptomsAssessmentIntegratedFinal;
```

## Navigation Structure

The updated navigation structure ensures users can access forms in multiple ways:

1. **Home Page** (`/`) - Central hub with links to all sections
2. **Combined View** (`/full-assessment`) - Tabbed interface for all major sections
3. **Individual Sections**:
   - `/emergency-symptoms` - Symptoms Assessment
   - `/medical-history` - Medical History
   - `/typical-day` - Typical Day

This redundancy ensures the UI is always accessible even if one approach has issues.

## Future Development Recommendations

1. **Import Path Standards**: Always use relative paths (`../`) rather than alias paths (`@/`) when using require() in Next.js Pages Router

2. **Error Handling**: Maintain the try/catch approach for component loading to gracefully handle any future issues

3. **Testing Strategy**: Test component loading across different routes to ensure consistent behavior

4. **Next.js Upgrade Path**: Consider upgrading fully to App Router in the future for better module resolution and more consistent behavior
