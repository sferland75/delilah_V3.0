### App Router Redirects

1. **Root App Router Configuration**:
   - Renamed `src/app/page.tsx` to resolve conflicts with Pages Router
   - Updated `src/app/layout.tsx` with clear documentation
   - Added fallback handlers for unmatched routes

2. **Assessment Section Redirects** (`src/app/assessment/[[...path]]/page.tsx`): Redirects all App Router assessment paths to their proper Pages Router implementations.

3. **Report Drafting Redirects** (`src/app/report-drafting/[[...path]]/page.tsx`): Redirects report drafting paths to the Pages Router.

4. **Import PDF Redirects** (`src/app/import/[[...path]]/page.tsx`): Redirects import functionality to the Pages Router.

### Enhanced Pages Router Implementation

1. **Full Assessment Page** (`src/pages/full-assessment.tsx`): 
   - Enhanced with proper component loading and error handling
   - Fixed issues with non-existent component files
   - Added informative fallback components
   - Changed default active tab to more stable sections

2. **Emergency Symptoms Page** (`src/pages/emergency-symptoms.tsx`): Direct access to the Symptoms Assessment component.
3. **Medical History Page** (`src/pages/medical-full.tsx`): Direct access to the Medical History component.
4. **Typical Day Page** (`src/pages/typical-day.tsx`): Direct access to the Typical Day component.
5. **Assessment Sections Directory** (`src/pages/assessment-sections.tsx`): A visual directory of all assessment sections with direct links.

### Component Fixes

1. **NavbarWrapper Component** (`src/components/navigation/NavbarWrapper.js`):
   - Created a wrapper to resolve casing conflicts between `Navbar.js` and `navbar.js`
   - Implements a fallback mechanism that tries multiple import paths
   - Provides a simple default implementation if neither file exists

2. **Component Loading Improvements**:
   - Implemented more robust component loading in full-assessment.tsx
   - Reduced dependency on non-existent files
   - Added proper fallback components for missing sections
   - Improved error messages and handling

### Navigation and UI

1. **Assessment Navigation Component** (`src/components/navigation/AssessmentNav.tsx`): Consistent navigation across the application.

## Implementation Approach

The implementation follows these principles:

1. **Preservation**: No existing functionality is removed or rewritten.
2. **Redirection**: The App Router now redirects to the corresponding Pages Router paths.
3. **Direct Component Loading**: Components are loaded directly from their source files to avoid export chain issues.
4. **Error Boundaries**: All component loading is wrapped in error boundaries for resilience.
5. **Context Integration**: All components maintain integration with the AssessmentContext.
6. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple component loading attempts with different file paths and export names.
7. **Conflict Resolution**: Systematic approach to resolving routing conflicts between App Router and Pages Router.
8. **Component Fixes**: Addressing casing conflicts and missing component files.

## Benefits of These Changes

1. **Consistent User Experience**: Users now see the same interface regardless of how they access sections.
2. **Eliminated Duplication**: No duplicate development efforts for components that already exist.
3. **Preserved Functionality**: All existing functionality is maintained and properly utilized.
4. **Simplified Navigation**: Clear navigation paths between all components.
5. **Resilient Implementation**: Proper error handling for component loading failures.
6. **Resolved Conflicts**: No more routing conflicts between App Router and Pages Router.
7. **Improved Component Loading**: More robust component loading with better fallbacks.

## Addressing Component Issues

During implementation, several component-related issues were identified:

1. **Missing Component Files**: Several components referenced in `full-assessment.tsx` didn't exist
2. **Component Casing Conflicts**: Files with names differing only in casing
3. **Undefined Component Errors**: Issues with component exports

These issues were addressed by:

1. Simplifying component loading to focus on components that work
2. Creating the NavbarWrapper to handle casing conflicts
3. Adding informative fallback components
4. Documenting recommended approaches for component standardization

## Addressing Styling Issues

While implementing the restoration, styling inconsistencies were identified across different sections. These issues are documented in STYLING_FIXES.md and include:

1. **Layout Inconsistencies**: Container padding, field spacing, and card layout variations.
2. **Component Styling Variations**: Form inputs, buttons, and text styling differences.
3. **Responsive Design Issues**: Sections that don't properly adapt to different screen sizes.

The recommended approach for addressing these styling issues includes:

1. Creating a styling guide with standard classes and component usage patterns.
2. Implementing common components with consistent styling.
3. Applying systematic fixes starting with layout issues and then addressing component styling.

## Routing Conflict Resolution

To resolve conflicts between the App Router and Pages Router, we implemented the following approach:

1. **Identify Conflicts**: Located specific conflicts where the same route was defined in both routers.
2. **Remove App Router Conflicts**: Renamed or removed conflicting App Router files.
3. **Enhance Redirection**: Implemented comprehensive redirect handlers in the App Router.
4. **Fallback Handlers**: Added fallback handlers to catch any unmatched routes.
5. **Documentation**: Created detailed documentation of the conflict resolution approach.

This strategy ensures that:
- The Pages Router remains the primary routing system
- All routes are accessible without conflicts
- Any attempt to access App Router paths is properly redirected

## Next Steps

The following additional steps are recommended to complete the restoration:

1. **Address Identified Styling Issues**: Implement the fixes outlined in STYLING_FIXES.md.
2. **Complete Component Standardization**: Follow the guidelines in COMPONENT_FIX_GUIDE.md.
3. **Enhanced UI Integration**: Complete the development of the assessment dashboard.
4. **Add Visual Feedback**: Include loading and saving indicators for better user experience.
5. **Unified Home Page**: Update the home page to provide clear access to all functionality.
6. **Comprehensive Testing**: Test all restored functionality to ensure proper integration.

## Testing Recommendations

To verify the changes, test:

1. **Navigation Flow**: Ensure all navigation paths work correctly.
2. **Component Loading**: Verify all components load and function properly.
3. **Data Persistence**: Confirm that data is properly maintained across navigation.
4. **Error Handling**: Test error scenarios by temporarily breaking component imports.
5. **Full Assessment Flow**: Complete a full assessment using the restored functionality.
6. **Responsive Testing**: Verify all sections display correctly on different screen sizes.
7. **Routing Conflicts**: Ensure no routing conflicts occur during usage.
8. **Component Resolution**: Verify that component fallbacks work as expected.

## Conclusion

The restoration changes ensure that all fully developed components are properly utilized, providing a consistent user experience and avoiding duplicate development efforts. The implementation follows best practices for maintainability, resilience, and user experience, while setting a clear path for addressing remaining component and styling issues.
