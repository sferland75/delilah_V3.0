## Implementation Details

### Multiple Levels of Tabs

The implementation includes multiple levels of tabs to match the original design:

1. **Top-level Tab Navigation**
   - Dashboard, Assessment, Import Documents, Generate Report

2. **Assessment Section Tabs**
   - Initial Assessment, Purpose & Methodology, Medical History, etc.

3. **Section-Specific Tabs**
   - For Initial Assessment: Demographics, Referral, Insurance, Medical, Notes
   - These tabs organize the content within each assessment section

### Form Implementation

Each form includes:
- Tab-based organization of form fields
- Proper form validation using zod and react-hook-form
- Appropriate field types and layout
- State preservation between tabs and sections
- Navigation between sections

### Navigation System

The navigation system enables:
- Movement between assessment sections via sidebar
- Navigation between tabs within each section
- Quick access to utilities
- Save and next/previous functionality

## Design Details

The UI closely follows the original design with several key components:

1. **Left Sidebar**
   - Numbered sections with active state indicators
   - Utility links with icons
   - Developer tools section

2. **Top Navigation**
   - App title and completion percentage
   - Import Documents and Generate Report buttons
   - Main tab navigation

3. **Section Tabs**
   - Assessment section navigation
   - Scrollable tabs for all sections

4. **Content Area**
   - Section title with section number
   - Section-specific tabs
   - Form fields organized by tab
   - Save and navigation buttons

## Testing

To test the implementation:
1. Navigate to `/assessment/initial` to view the Initial Assessment page
2. Use the tabs to navigate between Demographics, Referral, Insurance, etc.
3. Complete form fields and test validation
4. Navigate between sections using the sidebar or Next Section button

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Remaining Sections**
   - Create App Router versions of other assessment sections

2. **Enhance Tab Navigation**
   - Add section-specific tabs for each assessment section
   - Implement state persistence between tabs

3. **Data Management**
   - Implement shared context for form data
   - Save data when navigating between sections
   - Add data persistence through local storage or API
