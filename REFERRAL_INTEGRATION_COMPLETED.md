# Referral Document Integration - Implementation Status

**Date: March 1, 2025**

## Completed Tasks

### Referral Document Integration ✅

The following tasks for Referral Document Integration have been completed:

1. **Set up testing data folder with sample referral documents** ✅
   - Created `public/data/sample-referrals` directory
   - Added sample JSON and text files for testing
   - Created setup script for test environment

2. **Implement cross-section integration** ✅
   - Created `referralIntegration.ts` service with the following functions:
     - `integrateWithDemographics`: Maps client info to demographics section
     - `integrateWithPurpose`: Maps assessment types and requirements to purpose section
     - `integrateWithMedicalHistory`: Maps injury date and medical context to medical history
     - `detectSectionRequirements`: Detects section-specific requirements from referral data
     - `integrateAcrossSections`: Integrates referral data across all assessment sections

3. **Add unit tests for referral extraction** ✅
   - Created `enhancedReferralExtractor.test.js` to test enhanced extraction
   - Added comprehensive tests for all extraction functions
   - Created `referralIntegration.test.ts` to test cross-section integration

4. **Enhance confidence scoring for referral data** ✅
   - Created `ReferralConfidenceScorer.js` with sophisticated confidence scoring
   - Implemented cross-validation between different extracted fields
   - Added extraction method tracking for better confidence assessment
   - Enabled adaptive priority-based extraction

## Implementation Details

### Enhanced Referral Extraction

The REFERRALExtractor implementation now includes:

1. **Improved Pattern Matching**
   - Multiple pattern types for each field
   - Prioritized pattern matching
   - Context-aware extraction

2. **Confidence Scoring System**
   - Field-level confidence scores
   - Section-level confidence aggregation
   - Cross-validation between related fields
   - Extraction method tracking

3. **Extraction Methods**
   - `PATTERN_MATCH`: Direct pattern matching
   - `CONTEXT_MATCH`: Context-based extraction
   - `PROXIMITY_MATCH`: Proximity-based extraction
   - `INFERRED`: Logically inferred data

### Cross-Section Integration

The referral integration service provides:

1. **Demographics Integration**
   - Maps client info directly to demographics fields
   - Preserves existing data when present
   - Adds metadata tracking referral integration

2. **Purpose Integration**
   - Maps assessment types to purpose statement
   - Formats referral requirements in structured format
   - Integrates domains and criteria into purpose section

3. **Medical History Integration**
   - Maps date of loss to injury date
   - Adds context notes based on referral requirements
   - Identifies medical keywords in referral requirements

4. **Section-Specific Requirements**
   - Detects relevant requirements for each section
   - Provides prioritized to-do list for each section
   - Adds metadata to guide section content

## Next Steps

The following items should be addressed next:

1. **Create comprehensive UI tests**
   - Add integration tests for ReferralImport component
   - Test interaction between referral data and form components
   - Validate cross-section integration in UI

2. **Documentation**
   - Update user guide with referral integration details
   - Create tutorial for referral document import
   - Document cross-section integration for developers

## Usage

To test the referral integration:

1. Run the setup script:
   ```
   setup-referral-test-data.bat
   ```

2. Run the referral integration tests:
   ```
   npm test -- -t "referralIntegration"
   ```

3. Run the enhanced referral extractor tests:
   ```
   npm test -- -t "enhancedReferralExtractor"
   ```

## Known Issues

- Some specialized referral formats may still need custom patterns
- Integration with the UI components needs additional testing
- Confidence scoring may need further calibration based on user feedback

Please contact the development team with any questions or feedback.
