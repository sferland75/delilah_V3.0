===== Implementation Completed Successfully =====
The following components have been implemented:
1. Data-driven PatternMatcher with statistical confidence normalization
2. Section-specific extractors with prioritized field extraction:
   - SYMPTOMS extractor
   - DEMOGRAPHICS extractor
   - MEDICAL_HISTORY extractor
   - ENVIRONMENTAL extractor
   - ATTENDANT_CARE extractor
3. Adaptive pattern selection based on document type
4. Pattern effectiveness visualization dashboard

Next steps:
- Create additional section-specific extractors (FUNCTIONAL_STATUS, TYPICAL_DAY, ADLS)
- Optimize for large document processing
- Document pattern recognition best practices
