# Migration from Babel to SWC

## Changes Made

1. Removed custom Babel configuration (`.babelrc`) to enable Next.js to use its default SWC compiler
2. Restored font optimization using `next/font` in the root layout
3. Original Babel configuration has been preserved in `.babelrc.removed` for reference

## Benefits of SWC

- **Performance**: SWC is 20-100x faster than Babel for compilation
- **Next.js Feature Compatibility**: Full access to all Next.js features, including font optimization
- **Simplified Configuration**: Less maintenance overhead without custom Babel config
- **Optimized Bundles**: SWC can produce more efficient bundles in many cases

## What to Watch For

If you encounter any issues with the SWC compiler, they might be related to:

1. **Custom JSX Transformations**: If you were using custom JSX transforms
2. **Specialized Babel Plugins**: If you relied on specific Babel plugins not available in SWC
3. **Legacy Browser Support**: If you need to support very old browsers, you may need additional configuration

## Next Steps

If you need any customizations that were previously handled by Babel, you can configure SWC through the `next.config.js` file. For example:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // Existing config...
  
  // SWC configuration example (only add if needed)
  compiler: {
    // Example: Remove console.log in production
    removeConsole: process.env.NODE_ENV === "production",
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```
