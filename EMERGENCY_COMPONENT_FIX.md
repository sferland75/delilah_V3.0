# Emergency Component Fix

## Overview

This document describes the emergency component fix applied to resolve rendering issues in multiple sections of the Delilah V3.0 application.

## Problem

Several components in the application are experiencing rendering errors:
- Medical History: Working pre-existing conditions tab, but errors in other tabs
- Physical Symptoms: Error with form fields not accepting input
- Other sections: Similar rendering issues

## Emergency Fix Applied

We've implemented a temporary fix to keep the application functional while a more comprehensive solution is developed:

1. **Self-Contained Component Approach**: 
   - Using the MedicalHistorySelfContained component which has proven to work reliably
   - Temporarily replacing problematic sections with this component

2. **Benefits of this approach**:
   - Allows users to continue working with the application
   - Eliminates rendering errors
   - Provides consistent form experience across sections

## How to Apply the Fix

Run the `apply-emergency-component-fixes.bat` script, which:
1. Clears the Next.js cache
2. Creates a temp-fixes directory with the working component pattern
3. Applies the fix to the Medical History section
4. Applies similar fixes to other problematic sections
5. Starts the application with the fixes applied

## Limitations

This is a temporary solution with these limitations:
- Form fields may not exactly match the intended fields for each section
- Data saved through these temporary forms will need to be migrated later
- UI consistency is compromised in favor of functionality

## Next Steps

After this emergency fix:
1. Analyze the root cause of component rendering issues more thoroughly
2. Develop proper section-specific components using the self-contained pattern
3. Gradually replace the emergency fix components with proper implementations
4. Create a data migration plan for any data saved through temporary forms
