# Delilah V3.0 Integrated Application Guide

## Overview

Delilah V3.0 is a comprehensive assessment and report generation system that streamlines the workflow for healthcare professionals. The application integrates several key features:

1. **PDF Import with Pattern Recognition**: Automatically extract relevant data from uploaded medical documents and referrals
2. **Intelligent Form Population**: Pre-fill assessment forms based on extracted data
3. **Interactive Assessment Interface**: Complete comprehensive patient assessments with structured data collection
4. **Automated Report Drafting**: Generate professional reports with intelligent content suggestions

This document provides an overview of how these components work together to create a seamless workflow.

## Workflow Integration

### 1. PDF Import & Pattern Recognition

The PDF import system uses advanced pattern recognition to extract structured data from unstructured medical documents.

#### Key Features:
- Upload medical documents through a user-friendly interface
- Extract patient demographics, medical history, symptoms, and assessment data
- Process referral documents to identify insurance information and legal details
- View extracted data with confidence scores before integration

#### Usage:
```
/import/assessment
```

This page provides the entry point for document uploads. The system will process the PDF, extract data using pattern recognition, and prepare it for use in the assessment forms.

### 2. Assessment Form Population

Once data is extracted from documents, it's seamlessly integrated into the assessment workflow.

#### Key Features:
- Automatic pre-population of form fields based on extracted data
- Visual indicators for pre-populated fields with their data sources
- Ability to verify and modify extracted data
- Smart suggestions for fields that may need additional information

#### Data Flow:
```
PDF Upload → Pattern Recognition → Data Extraction → Form Population → User Verification
```

### 3. Comprehensive Assessment Interface

The application provides a structured, tab-based interface for completing comprehensive assessments across multiple domains.

#### Assessment Sections:
1. **Demographics & Initial Information**: Patient identification and basic details
2. **Purpose & Methodology**: Assessment goals and approaches used
3. **Medical History**: Comprehensive medical background and history
4. **Symptoms Assessment**: Detailed evaluation of symptoms across physical, cognitive, and emotional domains
5. **Functional Status**: Assessment of functional abilities and limitations
6. **Typical Day**: Analysis of daily activities before and after injury/condition
7. **Environmental Assessment**: Evaluation of home and workplace environments
8. **Activities of Daily Living**: Detailed assessment of independence in daily activities
9. **Attendant Care**: Care needs assessment and recommendations

Each section integrates with the others, creating a cohesive patient profile that informs the final report.

### 4. Intelligent Report Generation

The final component of the workflow is automated report drafting with intelligent content suggestions.

#### Key Features:
- Generate comprehensive reports based on collected assessment data
- Smart content suggestions based on patterns identified in the assessment
- Contextual recommendations for additional assessments or follow-ups
- Professional formatting with customizable templates
- Export options for different formats (PDF, DOCX)

#### Report Elements:
- Executive Summary
- Assessment Methodology
- Findings by Domain
- Recommendations and Care Plan
- Supporting Documentation References

## Technical Integration

### Pattern Recognition System

The pattern recognition system uses a multi-layered approach:

1. **Text Extraction**: Converts PDF content to searchable text
2. **Section Recognition**: Identifies document sections using learned patterns
3. **Data Extraction**: Pulls specific data points from identified sections
4. **Confidence Scoring**: Assigns confidence levels to extracted data
5. **Data Mapping**: Maps extracted data to application data model

```javascript
// Example pattern definition
{
  sectionName: "Medical History",
  patterns: [
    /Past Medical History/i,
    /Previous Medical Conditions/i,
    /Medical Background/i
  ],
  dataPoints: [
    { name: "conditions", pattern: /(?:diagnosed with|history of)\s+(.*?)(?:\.|\n)/i },
    { name: "surgeries", pattern: /(?:surgeries|surgical history):\s+(.*?)(?:\.|\n)/i }
  ]
}
```

The system continuously improves through usage, with new patterns being added based on document processing outcomes.

### Form Integration Architecture

Assessment forms are integrated with the data model through a bidirectional mapping system:

1. **Context-to-Form Mapping**: Transforms application context data to form structure
2. **Form-to-Context Mapping**: Transforms form submissions back to context structure
3. **Data Persistence**: Maintains state during the assessment process
4. **Cross-Section References**: Allows data sharing between assessment sections

This architecture ensures consistent data handling throughout the application.

### Report Generation Engine

The report generation engine uses structured assessment data to create comprehensive reports:

1. **Data Aggregation**: Collects relevant data from all assessment sections
2. **Narrative Construction**: Creates natural language descriptions of findings
3. **Recommendation Engine**: Suggests appropriate recommendations based on assessment data
4. **Template Application**: Applies professional formatting using customizable templates
5. **Document Generation**: Creates final documents in desired formats
