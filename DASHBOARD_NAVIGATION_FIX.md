# Dashboard and Navigation Fix

## Issue

After resolving the build errors, the application was running but the initial page displayed was missing expected tabs and full development. The root route was not properly redirecting to the fully developed dashboard page.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Dashboard Page**
   - Updated the dashboard page in `/app/dashboard/page.tsx` with a comprehensive design
   - Added workflow steps, quick access cards, and development options from the original design
   - Integrated Lucide icons for improved visual hierarchy
   - Maintained consistent styling with the rest of the application

2. **Root Page Redirection**
   - Updated the root page (`/app/page.tsx`) to correctly redirect to `/dashboard`
   - Changed `router.push` to `router.replace` for cleaner navigation

3. **Verified Navigation Component**
   - Confirmed that the sidebar navigation links are pointing to the correct routes
   - Maintained consistency with the section structure

## Expected Behavior

Now when you visit the application:

1. You should briefly see a loading screen
2. You will be redirected to the dashboard page
3. The dashboard will display:
   - A header with the application name and description
   - The three-step workflow cards (Import, Assessment, Reports)
   - Quick access cards for common functions
   - Development options
   - Intelligence features information

## App Router Migration

These changes continue the migration to the App Router architecture, with the dashboard now fully implemented in the `/app` directory. The app maintains the same look and functionality as the original Pages Router implementation but with the benefits of the newer architecture.

## Testing

To verify these changes are working:

1. Visit the root of your application (`/`)
2. Confirm you are redirected to the dashboard page
3. Verify all UI elements are present and styled correctly
4. Test navigation to other sections through the dashboard links
