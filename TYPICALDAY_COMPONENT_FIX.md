# TypicalDay Component Fix

## Issue Summary

The TypicalDay component was experiencing three main issues:

1. **Missing Icon Import Error**: The component was trying to import `ClipboardClock` from `lucide-react`, but this icon doesn't exist in the library.
2. **Context API Mismatch**: The component was using incorrect hooks and methods to access and update the AssessmentContext.
3. **Context Structure Error**: The component was incorrectly trying to access `state.typicalDay` when the context actually uses `data.typicalDay`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Icon Import

Replaced the non-existent `ClipboardClock` icon with the available `ClipboardCheck` icon:

```javascript
// Before
import { Sun, Clock, Moon, History, ClipboardClock, InfoIcon } from 'lucide-react';

// After
import { Sun, Clock, Moon, History, ClipboardCheck, InfoIcon } from 'lucide-react';
```

Also updated the usage of the icon in the component:

```javascript
// Before
<ClipboardClock className="h-4 w-4" />

// After
<ClipboardCheck className="h-4 w-4" />
```

### 2. Fixed Context Usage

Updated the component to use the correct context hooks and structure:

```javascript
// Before - First incorrect implementation
const { state, dispatch } = useAssessmentContext();
const contextData = state.typicalDay || {};

// Then - Second incorrect implementation trying to mix approaches
const { data, updateSection } = useAssessment();
const contextData = data.typicalDay || {};

// Final correct implementation
const { data, updateSection } = useAssessment();
const contextData = data.typicalDay || {};
```

Also updated the context update method:

```javascript
// Before - First incorrect implementation
dispatch({ type: 'UPDATE_SECTION', payload: { section: 'typicalDay', data: typicalDayData } });

// Final correct implementation
updateSection('typicalDay', typicalDayData);
```

### 3. Fixed Context Structure Access

After examining the AssessmentContext implementation, we found that it uses a different structure than what the component was trying to access:

```javascript
// In AssessmentContext.tsx
const AssessmentContext = React.createContext<AssessmentContextType>({
  data: {},
  updateSection: () => {},
  setAssessmentData: () => {},
  updateReferral: () => {},
});
```

The component was trying to use a Redux-style state/dispatch pattern, but the context actually provides direct data and update functions.

## Verification

After making these changes, the TypicalDay component should load correctly without the following errors:

1. Import error: `'ClipboardClock' is not exported from 'lucide-react'`
2. Component error: `Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined`
3. Runtime error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'typicalDay')`

The component can now be accessed from the main assessment page and should function correctly with proper context integration.

## Related Components

The TypicalDay component relies on several other components that were verified to be working correctly:

1. **TimeBlock.tsx**: A sub-component that renders each time period (morning, afternoon, evening, night)
2. **ActivityBlock.tsx**: A sub-component for individual activities within each time period
3. **schema.ts**: Defines the data structure and validation for the TypicalDay component

All of these components are properly implemented and should work with the main TypicalDay component after the fixes.

## Future Considerations

To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Icon Usage**: Always verify that imported icons exist in the lucide-react library
2. **Context Pattern**: Standardize context usage patterns across all components
   - Use `useAssessment()` hook consistently instead of mixing with `useAssessmentContext()`
   - Follow the `{ data, updateSection }` pattern instead of state/dispatch
3. **Component Testing**: Add tests to verify that components load correctly and use context properly
4. **Context Documentation**: Provide clear documentation on how to use the context API to prevent misunderstandings
