# Component Rendering Fix Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a systematic fix for component rendering issues in the Delilah V3.0 application. The primary focus was on the Medical History section, which was experiencing rendering errors when users interacted with form elements.

## Key Changes

1. **Export Standardization**:
   - Components now export both named and default exports
   - Proper index files ensure consistent imports

2. **Form Handling Simplification**:
   - Using simpler direct form inputs instead of complex UI components
   - Consistent use of useFormContext() for form operations

3. **Error Boundaries**:
   - All form sections wrapped with ErrorBoundary components
   - Improved error reporting and user feedback

4. **Schema Validation**:
   - Clear type definitions and validation rules
   - Default form states to prevent undefined errors

## How to Apply the Fix

1. Run `apply-component-rendering-fixes.bat` to apply all changes
2. Test the application with `run-with-fixed-components.bat`
3. Verify that the Medical History section renders correctly

## Verification Process

1. Click on the "Pre-Existing" tab and add a condition
2. Navigate to other tabs and add entries
3. Save the form and verify data persistence
4. Reload the page and confirm data loading

## Next Steps

This fix can be extended to other sections experiencing similar issues by following the same pattern:

1. Standardize component exports
2. Simplify form handling
3. Add error boundaries
4. Improve schema validation
