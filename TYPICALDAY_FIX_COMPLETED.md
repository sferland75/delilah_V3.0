# Typical Day Implementation Fix Completed

All tasks from the Typical Day Implementation Fix Roadmap have been completed. The component now supports both regular and irregular sleep schedules and provides a more robust user experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Standardization ✅
- Created unified schema in `src/sections/6-TypicalDay/schema.ts`
- Added proper validation for both regular and irregular schedules
- Ensured consistent handling of time periods

### 2. Context Integration Fixed ✅
- Standardized on `useAssessment()` hook throughout component
- Using `updateSection()` method consistently for updates
- Fixed data access patterns to use proper structure
- Added error boundary components to catch rendering errors

### 3. Irregular Sleep Schedule Feature Improved ✅
- Replaced browser prompts with proper UI components
- Implemented radio toggle between regular/irregular modes
- Added validation for irregular schedule descriptions
- Ensured proper state preservation when switching tabs

### 4. Mapper Service Enhanced ✅
- Added robust error handling to `typicalDayMapper.ts`
- Improved text parsing algorithms for activity detection
- Added backward compatibility for legacy data formats
- Documented input/output formats

### 5. User Experience Improved ✅
- Added success notifications when saving data
- Improved form layout and visual hierarchy
- Added clear validation feedback
- Ensured consistent UI between regular and irregular modes

### 6. Tests Updated ✅
- Updated test cases in `TypicalDay.test.tsx`
- Added tests for irregular schedule functionality
- Created tests for context integration
- Added tests for backward compatibility

### 7. Documentation Added ✅
- Created implementation guide in `docs/TYPICALDAY_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`
- Documented the data structure and validation rules
- Added examples of usage

## Files Modified

1. `src/sections/6-TypicalDay/schema.ts` - Updated schema with proper validation
2. `src/sections/6-TypicalDay/types.ts` - Aligned types with schema
3. `src/sections/6-TypicalDay/components/TypicalDay.integrated.tsx` - Fixed integration with context
4. `src/sections/6-TypicalDay/components/IrregularSleepTrigger.tsx` - Replaced with proper UI
5. `src/services/typicalDayMapper.ts` - Enhanced mapper service
6. `src/sections/6-TypicalDay/components/TimeBlock.tsx` - Updated to work with new schema
7. `src/sections/6-TypicalDay/__tests__/TypicalDay.test.tsx` - Updated tests

## Next Steps

While all the required fixes have been implemented, here are some potential future improvements:

1. Create a custom form component for shift work patterns
2. Add data visualization for comparing pre/post accident routines
3. Implement a print-friendly view for assessment reports
4. Add support for importing activities from calendar data
