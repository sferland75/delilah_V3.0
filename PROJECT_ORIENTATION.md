```

## Project Overview
Delilah is an integrated occupational therapy assessment and report generation system. Key components include:
- Medical History section (fully tested)
- UI component library (needs coverage improvement)
- Test utilities (under enhancement)
- Form validation system
- Typical Day tracking (core functionality)

### Key Features
- Digital OT assessment form (web-based)
- Structured data collection with validation
- JSON export functionality
- Automated report generation
- Clinical narrative synthesis
- Agentic drafting support

## Core Architecture

### Assessment Data â†’ Report Pipeline:
```

```

## Implementation Status

### Complete Features
- âœ… Web-based assessment form
- âœ… Form validation system
- âœ… Medical history management
- âœ… Data persistence
- âœ… Clinical reporting
- âœ… Typical Day core functionality

### Under Development
- ðŸš§ UI component test coverage (59.25%)
- ðŸš§ Form component testing (71.42%)
- ðŸš§ Integration testing patterns
- ðŸš§ Environmental Assessment section

## Testing Requirements

### Minimum Coverage Thresholds
1. Statements: 80%
2. Branch: 90%
3. Functions: 70%
4. Lines: 80%

### Testing Priorities
1. UI Components
   - select.tsx (16.66%)
   - card.tsx (50%)
   - form.tsx (71.42%)
   - alert.tsx (66.66%)
   - tabs.tsx (80%)

2. Integration Tests
   - Form state persistence
   - Cross-component communication
   - Error boundary testing

### Test Documentation
- Follow test file structure in `/src/sections/3-MedicalHistory`
- Use test utilities from `/src/tests/utils.tsx`
- Document testing patterns
- Maintain knowledge graph synchronization
- Consolidated mocks in src/__mocks__

## Getting Help
1. Check test examples in `/src/sections/3-MedicalHistory`
2. Review testing documentation
3. Use test utilities
4. Study component patterns

## Next Steps
1. Review `NEXT_DEVELOPER.md` for detailed guidance
2. Run test coverage report
3. Fix UI component tests
4. Improve test utilities
