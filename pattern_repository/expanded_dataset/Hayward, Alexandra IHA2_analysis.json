PURPOSE OF REFERRAL :  At   the   request   of   MR.   Frank   McNally   of   McNally   Gervan   law   fi rm,   this   therapist   re-engaged   with  Ms.   Hayward   and   completed   an   in-home   reassessment.   An   OCF18   for   this   assessment   was  submi \u0000 ed   to   the   insurer   for   considera \u0000 on   in   HCAI   and   subsequently   denied.   This   therapist   has  proceeded   to   complete   this   assessment   and   recommenda \u0000 ons   for   ongoing   OT   treatment   with  support from an RA is recommended.  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:  Ms.   Hayward   was,   prior   to   the   subject   motor   vehicle   accident,   living   with   her   mother,   assis \u0000 ng  with   the   care   of   her   young   nephew   for   the   summer   of   2019.   She   was   in   the   process   of  interviewing   for   work   as   a   recep \u0000 onist   at   UPS   to   start   in   the   Fall   of   2019   when   the   subject  motor   vehicle   accident   occurred.   Ms.   Hayward   presents   with   a   history   of   mental   health,   trauma  and addic \u0000 on issues which were further triggered by the subject motor vehicle accident.  On   August   5,   2019,   Ms.   Hayward   reported   being   out   with   friends   “hanging   out”.   She   was   the  restrained   passenger   when   the   driver   took   a   corner   at   a   high   rate   of   speed   and   rolled   the  vehicle   mul \u0000 ple   \u0000 mes   over   a   50   yard   distance.   As   a   result   of   the   subject   motor   vehicle   accident  of August 5, 2019, Ms. Hayward sustained the following injuries:  ●   Sha \u0000 ered L3  ●   Fractured ribs, mul \u0000 ple  ●   Ruptured bowels, 3 inches of bowel surgically resected  ●   Right wrist bony injury  ●   Right ankle fracture  ●   Glass in her eye  ______________________________________________________________________________  Alexandra Hayward   Claim #: 001664663   Page   2   of   19\n\n●   Two broken teeth  ●   Concussion  Upon   arrival   at   the   hospital,   Ms.   Hayward   was   assessed   in   the   ER   and   then   admi \u0000 ed   for   urgent  bowel   resec \u0000 on   and   subsequent   spinal   surgery,   5   days   later.   Ms.   Hayward   spent   17   days   in   the  ICU   then   moved   over   to   the   trauma   unit   for   one   month   before   being   discharged   to   her   parents’  care.   She later moved to a family co \u0000 age where she recovered and obtained OT services.  Ms.   Hayward   noted   that   she   moved   back   in   with   her   mother   approximately   5   months   ago   with  her   boyfriend,   Adam.   She   notes   that   she   has   not   made   use   of   any   cocaine   since   approximately  January   of   2023   and   is   commi \u0000 ed   to   her   ongoing   sobriety   from   this   substance.   She   notes   that  she   and   her   boyfriend   made   a   conscious   decision   to   “grow   up”   over   the   last   year,   referring   to   a  decision   to   reduce   the   partying   pa \u0000 erns   and   eliminate   hard   drug   consump \u0000 on.   Ms.   Hayward  notes   that   she   con \u0000 nues   to   struggle   with   her   daily   rou \u0000 ne,   which   remains   void   of   any  meaningful   ac \u0000 vity.   She   does   however   at   this   \u0000 me   share   her   desire   to   par \u0000 cipate   in   treatment,  no \u0000 ng that “I was not ready for this last   \u0000 me we tried”.  From   a   physical   perspec \u0000 ve,   Ms.   Hayward   currently   presents   with   pain   symptoms   a ff ec \u0000 ng   her  lower   back   (7/10)   and   right   ankle   (7/10   with   ac \u0000 vity).   She   reports   ongoing   bowel   issues   which  have   improved   to   some   extent   with   the   removal   of   dairy   products   from   her   diet.   She   has  received   a   referral   for   a   die \u0000 cian   consulta \u0000 on   through   her   Nurse   Prac \u0000 \u0000 oner   and   noted   that   she  wished   to   explore   other   dietary   changes   which   could   posi \u0000 vely   impact   her   abdominal  discomfort.  Ms.   Hayward   noted   that   she   con \u0000 nues   to   struggle   with   depressive   symptoms   which   have   an  ongoing,   daily   impact   on   her   func \u0000 on.   While   she   tries   to   stay   busy   throughout   the   day,   she  notes   that   much   of   her   \u0000 me   is   spent   res \u0000 ng,   watching   videos   or   otherwise   pu \u0000 ering   in   her  mother’s   home.   While   she   does   not   engage   in   any   formal   deep   cleaning   of   the   home   due   to  pain symptoms, she will assist through washing of dishes and managing her laundry.  Ms.   Hayward   is   at   this   \u0000 me   not   engaged   in   any   form   of   therapy   or   pharmaceu \u0000 cal   management  of   her   emo \u0000 onal   and   pain   symptoms.   She   has   reportedly   undergone   x-rays   in   August   of   2022  which   revealed   an   unhealed   ankle   fracture,   which   has   received   no   further   medical   a \u0000 en \u0000 on.  She   indicated   that   she   did   not   follow-up   on   recommenda \u0000 ons   to   wear   her   in fl atable   walking  boot and she did not pursue any follow-up care due to her state of mind at the   \u0000 me.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Alexandra Hayward   Claim #: 001664663   Page   3   of   19\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  A \u0000 endant Care:  Ms.   Hayward   does   not   present   with   any   A \u0000 endant   Care   Needs   at   this   \u0000 me   and   a   Form   1   has  thus not been completed as part of this assessment.

Egarhos dated September 23, 2021 re: Post-104 IRB  PRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY:  Ms.   Hayward   noted   that   she   was   in   good   physical   health   at   the   \u0000 me   of   the   accident.   She   was   an  ac \u0000 ve   young   woman   who   engaged   in   a   number   of   sports   and   outdoor   recrea \u0000 onal   ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es.  She   noted   having   had   some   bowel   issues   and   issues   with   anxiety   in   the   past   for   which   she  obtained   medical   care.   She   denied   the   presence   of   concurrent   medical   condi \u0000 ons   or   past  injuries   which   could   impact   her   clinical   presenta \u0000 on   or   the   course   of   recovery   from   the   injuries  she sustained in the subject motor vehicle accident.  From   a   psychological   perspec \u0000 ve,   Ms.   Hayward   noted   that   she   has   experienced   a   number   of  losses   over   the   last   few   years   which   have   had   an   undeniable   impact   on   her   mental   health.   She  noted   having   lost   her   aunt,   whom   she   describes   as   her   best   friend   in   2015.   Her   brother   passed  away   in   2016   and   her   uncle   with   whom   she   was   also   close,   died   in   2017.   While   s \u0000 ll   grieving  these   concurrent   close   family   losses,   Ms.   Hayward   was   involved   in   a   serious   motor   vehicle  accident   in   August   of   2019.   Ms.   Hayward   lost   her   father   in   the   winter   of   2022   and   this   loss  compounded what appeared to be a precarious emo \u0000 onal state.  A   review   of   the   medical   fi le   con fi rmed   reports   of   mental   issues   which   predated   the   subject  motor   vehicle   accident.   Contact   with   mental   health   professionals   are   noted   in   2015   where  issues   surrounding   anxiety   and   substance   use   are   highlighted.   She   was   reportedly   encouraged  to   par \u0000 cipate   in   various   anxiety   and   addic \u0000 ons   groups.   Notes   indicate   that   Ms.   Hayward   had  di ffi culty   opening-up   and   talking   in   therapy   and   group   a \u0000 endance   was   discon \u0000 nued.   Ms.  Hayward   has   not   agreed   to   par \u0000 cipate   in   any   form   of   mental   health   treatment   involving   talk  therapy components.  A   tele-medicine   clinical   report   from   CHEO   dated   December   9,   2016   notes   that   Ms.   Hayward  began   experiencing   visual,   auditory   and   soma \u0000 c   hallucina \u0000 ons   in   September   of   2016   following  the use of cocaine and cannabis.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Alexandra Hayward   Claim #: 001664663   Page   7   of   19\n\nMECHANISM OF INJURY:  On   August   5,   2019,   Ms.   Hayward   reported   being   out   “hanging   out   with   friends”.   She   was   the  restrained   passenger   when   the   driver   “took   a   corner   too   fast”   and   the   car   reportedly   fl ipped  over   a   50   yard   distance,   mul \u0000 ple   \u0000 mes.   Ms.   Hayward   denies   any   loss   of   consciousness.   Her  friend   reportedly   exited   the   vehicle   fi rst   and   Ms.   Hayward   informed   him   that   she   couldn’t   move  and   could   not   feel   her   legs.   First   responders   extracted   Ms.   Hayward   with   jaws   of   life   and   she  was   taken   by   ambulance   to   the   O \u0000 awa   Hospital   –   Civic   Campus,   where   she   was   assessed   for   her  injuries.   She   was   assessed   in   the   ER   and   then   admi \u0000 ed   for   urgent   bowel   resec \u0000 on   surgery.  Spinal   surgery   was   performed   5   days   later.   Ms.   Hayward   reported   that   she   spent   17   days   in   the  ICU   then   moved   over   to   the   trauma   unit   for   one   month   before   being   discharged   to   her   parents’  care.  NATURE OF INJURY:  As a result of the subject motor vehicle accident, Ms. Hayward sustained the following injuries:  ●   Sha \u0000 ered L3 (ORIF, 4 pins and 2 rods)  ●   Fractured ribs, mul \u0000 ple  ●   Ruptured bowels, 3 inches of bowel surgically resected  ●   Right wrist bony injury  ●   Right ankle fracture  ●   Glass in her eye  ●   Two broken teeth  Ms.   Hayward   also   noted   being   inves \u0000 gated   for   presence   of   post-concussive   symptoms   but   was  unable to recall the date of this examina \u0000 on or the specialist who assessed her.  COURSE OF RECOVERY TO DATE:  Ms.   Hayward   reported   that   she   has   not   been   involved   in   any   form   of   treatment   since   the   last  contact   with   this   therapist.   She   noted   that   her   focus   over   the   past   year   had   been   on   “gathering  myself”   and   ge \u0000 ng   her   life   back   together.   The   move   to   her   mom’s   home   with   her   boyfriend  has served as an anchor of sorts to support her sobriety from hard drugs.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Alexandra Hayward   Claim #: 001664663   Page   8   of   19\n\nCURRENT MEDICAL/REHABILITATION TEAM:  Health  Professional  Name and  Specialty  Date of Last Appointment/  Frequency of  appointments  Outcome of Last  Appointment  Date of Next  Appointment  Registered Nurse  Prac \u0000 \u0000 oner -  Jackie Abernathy  Last seen 1 month ago.

She   was   told   in  August   of   2022   to   wear   her   in fl atable   boot  which   she   did   not   do   as   she   found   that   using  the   boot   “throws   my   back   out”.

She   noted   being   prone   to  dropping items in her grip.  7/10  Hypersensi \u0000 vity to light   She   experiences   nausea,   “thumping  headaches”.

A \u0000 er   wearing   her   glasses   all   day   she   will  experience   this   same   pa \u0000 ern   of   symptoms  upon removing her eyewear in the evening.  NA  Cogni \u0000 ve Symptoms:  From   a   cogni \u0000 ve   perspec \u0000 ve,   Ms.   Hayward   noted   that   she   realizes   now   how   she   struggles   with  a   number   of   cogni \u0000 ve   func \u0000 ons.   She   explained   that   these   issues   did   not   appear   so   obvious   to  her however she has been   fi nding issues with the following:  ●   Short-term   memory   is   “really   bad”.   She   does   not   no \u0000 ce   it   as   much   as   her   friends   and  family   do.   Noteworthy   that   Ms.   Hayward   was   not   prepared   for   this   OT   appointment,  appearing   surprised   at   this   therapist’s   arrival   despite   a   recent   scheduling   ac \u0000 vity.   She  notes having signi fi cant di ffi culty tracking appointments.  ●   Previously   an   avid   reader,   Ms.   Hayward   notes   that   she   struggles   to   read   for   extended  periods   of   \u0000 me.   She   keeps   her   mind   occupied   by   comple \u0000 ng   Sudoku   puzzles,   playing  solitaire   or   playing   games   on   her   phone.   She   fi nds   she   can   manage   to   focus   on   lighter  ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es but struggles with anything more complex (such as reading a novel).  ●   She   notes   no   concerns   with   fi nancial   management   at   this   \u0000 me   due   to   a   lack   of   income  and resources. “I have no   fi nances to manage”.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Alexandra Hayward   Claim #: 001664663   Page   10   of   19\n\nEmo \u0000 onal Symptoms:  Ms.   Hayward   noted   that   overall,   she   feels   quite   depressed   most   of   the   \u0000 me.   She   con \u0000 nues   to  struggle   with   the   mul \u0000 ple   losses   she   has   experienced   and   noted   having   lost   a   close   friend   two  months   ago   to   a   drug   overdose.   Despite   this,   she   does   report   a   be \u0000 er   ability   to   cope   with   grief,  especially   since   stopping   the   use   of   cocaine   and   seeing   improvements   in   her   sleep   pa \u0000 ern.   She  notes   that   she   will   con \u0000 nue   to   make   use   of   alcohol   in   moderate   quan \u0000 \u0000 es   on   weekends   (usually  a   few   drinks   on   Saturday)   and   will   consume   a   small   amount   of   cannabis   before   bed.   She   notes  that   she   has   a   really   di ffi cult   \u0000 me   ge \u0000 ng   going   as   a   result   of   poor   mo \u0000 va \u0000 on   and   a   lack   of  meaningful   ac \u0000 vity.   She   noted   that   she   would   like   to   return   to   work   and   not   being   able   to  contribute   fi nancially has been quite di ffi cult for her.  Symptom Management Strategies:  Ms.   Hayward   presented   with   no   symptom   management   strategies   at   this   \u0000 me   other   than   to  avoid   physical   ac \u0000 vity   which   could   fl are   her   symptoms.   She   is   making   e ff orts   to   alter   her   diet   by  removing   dairy   products   and   a \u0000 emp \u0000 ng   to   quell   her   irritable   bowel   issues.   Other   than   that,  she notes having no means of managing her symptoms.  Typical Day Post-Accident:  Since   moving-in   with   her   mother   and   boyfriend,   Ms.   Hayward   noted   having   developed   some  semblance   of   a   rou \u0000 ne,   surrounding   her   boyfriend’s   work   schedule.   She   reported   that   her   days  generally unfold as-follows:  ●   Wakes at 6am, makes Adam’s lunch  ●   Wakes Adam up, drives him to work, gets co ff ee  ●   Back home at 7:30am  ●   Help   her   nephew   Landon   (13)   get   out   of   the   door   (she   notes   behavioural   challenges  requiring her support to get him to school on   \u0000 me)  ●   Will help with some dishes “at   \u0000 mes”.  ●   Will   fi nish her co ff ee and watch a show.  ●   She   will   spend   \u0000 me   on   her   phone   and   notes   having   been   mindful   of   the   amount   of   \u0000 me  she spends on her mobile device.  ●   She   will   make   a   list   of   things   to   do,   “anything   but   scroll   on   my   phone”.   She   will   for  example fold some clothes, do laundry, make a snack  ●   Pu \u0000 ers throughout the day  ______________________________________________________________________________  Alexandra Hayward   Claim #: 001664663   Page   11   of   19\n\n●   At 3pm she will make a warm dish for Adam as he is hungry a \u0000 er work  ●   At 4 - 4:30 she drives and picks-up Adam  ●   Will spend the night watching tv, “chilling with Adam”.  ●   Will go to bed at around 10 (some \u0000 mes sooner, some \u0000 mes later)  Ms.   Haywards   indicated   that   she   recently   obtained   a   membership   at   Any \u0000 me   Fitness   with   her  mom,   adding   that   “I   am   just   ge \u0000 ng   comfortable”,   referring   to   her   limited   a \u0000 endance   and  limited   breadth   of   exercises   she   performs   when   there.   She   reported   a \u0000 emp \u0000 ng   to   go   once  weekly   where   she   will   do   some   cycling,   walk   on   a   treadmill.   She   reported   a   hesitancy   to   li \u0000  weights   due   to   her   discomfort   around   seasoned   weightli \u0000 ers   and   feelings   of   inadequacy.   She  noted   that   she   would   like   to   go   to   a   class   (such   as   pilates)   but   is   uncomfortable   being   around  other   people.   She   also   shared   fears   that   she   would   not   be   able   to   keep   up   with   the   class   and  have to explain why she is unable to do certain things.

She relies on her mother to manage these more physically-demanding tasks.

She   would  wake in the late-a \u0000 ernoon and takeover the care of Ms. Hayward’s nephew.  At   the   \u0000 me   of   this   assessment,   Ms.   Hayward   noted   that   she   remains   involved   in   suppor \u0000 ng   her  nephew   through   the   morning   rou \u0000 ne   to   get   him   to   school   on   \u0000 me.

At   the   \u0000 me   of   this   assessment,   Ms.   Hayward   noted   that   “I   want   to   work   really   bad”.   She  highlighted   not   having   any   idea   how   to   approach   this   situa \u0000 on   as   she   fears   being   unable   to  meet   job   pace   demands   as   a   result   of   her   physical   and   cogni \u0000 ve   issues.

She   was   an  ac \u0000 ve   young   woman   who   engaged   in   a   number   of   sports   and   outdoor   recrea \u0000 onal   ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es.  She   noted   having   had   some   bowel   issues   and   issues   with   anxiety   in   the   past   for   which   she  obtained   medical   care.   She   denied   the   presence   of   concurrent   medical   condi \u0000 ons   or   past  injuries   which   could   impact   her   clinical   presenta \u0000 on   or   the   course   of   recovery   from   the   injuries  she sustained in the subject motor vehicle accident.  From   a   psychological   perspec \u0000 ve,   Ms.   Hayward   noted   that   she   has   experienced   a   number   of  losses   over   the   last   few   years   which   have   had   an   undeniable   impact   on   her   mental   health.   She  noted   having   lost   her   aunt,   whom   she   describes   as   her   best   friend   in   2015.   Her   brother   passed  away   in   2016   and   her   uncle   with   whom   she   was   also   close,   died   in   2017.   While   s \u0000 ll   grieving  these   concurrent   close   family   losses,   Ms.   Hayward   was   involved   in   a   serious   motor   vehicle  accident   in   August   of   2019.   Ms.   Hayward   lost   her   father   in   the   winter   of   2022   and   this   loss  compounded what appeared to be a precarious emo \u0000 onal state.  A   review   of   the   medical   fi le   con fi rmed   reports   of   mental   issues   which   predated   the   subject  motor   vehicle   accident.   Contact   with   mental   health   professionals   are   noted   in   2015   where  issues   surrounding   anxiety   and   substance   use   are   highlighted.   She   was   reportedly   encouraged  to   par \u0000 cipate   in   various   anxiety   and   addic \u0000 ons   groups.

Ms.  Hayward   has   not   agreed   to   par \u0000 cipate   in   any   form   of   mental   health   treatment   involving   talk  therapy components.  A   tele-medicine   clinical   report   from   CHEO   dated   December   9,   2016   notes   that   Ms.   Hayward  began   experiencing   visual,   auditory   and   soma \u0000 c   hallucina \u0000 ons   in   September   of   2016   following  the use of cocaine and cannabis.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Alexandra Hayward   Claim #: 001664663   Page   7   of   19",
