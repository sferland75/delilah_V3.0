The referral was for the introduction of  Occupational Therapy services to assist   Ms. Pasqua in   addressing the significant deterioration in  function as a result of psychological struggles   subsequent   to her husband ’ s involvement in two  motor vehicle acc idents   in 2016 and 2017. An OCF18 was submitted for this assessment  following a screening ass essment with Ms. Pasqua and   a conversation with her insurance  adjuster Mr. Ian Christie. The OCF18 w as approved in full for the completion of this In - Home  Assessment.  SUMMARY O F FINDINGS:  Ms. Pasqua is a   31 y ear - old mother of   two young children   whose   husband was involved in two  motor vehicle accidents on August 8, 2016   and May 19, 2017. Following these two motor  vehicle accident s, Ms. Pasqua de scribes changes in her husband ’ s personality   and behaviours  which have a   significant impact on her own mental health. She describes   issues with verbal  aggression and a ge neral   sense of detachment within the couple which has led her to experience  severe symptoms   o f   depression and anxiety.  Prior to the subject motor vehicle accidents, Ms. Pasqua describes herself as   functioning wel l in  all aspects of her life. She was engaged in mana ging the family home, preparing meals for her  family,   and caring for her   child (the second being born after the subject MVAs ). She reports a  healthy relationship with her husband and a number of close   friendships. She was physically  active and   reported no significant pre - existing medical issues. She notes having been di agnosed  with a learning disability   as a child, having only begun speaking at age 3. She went on to  complete most of her high sch ool credits and reports having completed a n aesthetician  certificate .  At the time of this assessment, Ms.   Pasqua presented with a high degree of functional  deactivation. She rarely leaves the home and noted severe anxiety when outside her home.   She  avoids   eye contact when out in public and   experiences   severe anxiety when riding as a passenger  in a vehicle.   She now rarely drives and when she does it i s only for short distances, with severe  levels of anxiety. She noted that she fears having a p anic attack while behind the wheel.   Ms.  Pasqua and this therapist   took a short walk to the mailbox located 200 me ters from her home  which produced a severe anxiety response requiring this therapist to   intervene   with a guided  breathing exercise.   While at home, Ms. Pasqua noted that she does little in   the way of  contributing to the management of th e home. She rarely cleans , noting that she spends her days  “ on autopilot ” . She will spend most of the day sitting on the couch   “ z oned - out ”   in front of the  television   watching children ’ s shows while h er two childre n play in the living room.   She rarely  prepares meals for her family and reported a sense of immense guilt at her   inability to do more  for her   family.   Ms. Pasqua noted a significant decreased in her overall self - care including  decreased   grooming   and infrequent showering.   She has been avoiding contact   with close friends  and has become highly socially isolated. She noted that her fri ends have become upset at her  lack of responsiveness to texts and emails.\n\nDate of Report:   2021 - 03 - 31  ______________________________________________________________________________  Christina   Pasqua   Claim #:   5030704357   Page   3   of   14  Ms. Pasqua would greatly benefit from the introduction of Occupational Therapy to deliver a  comprehensive   Functional R eactivation Program.   She requires professi onal support of an OT in  tandem with her treating psychologist to effect   substantial change to her level of function. The  program will be guided with a progressive structure of functional goals which will be client -  driven and focussed on   assisting Ms. P asqua in gradually re - integrating a spects of pre - accident  function to her day to day activities.  RECOMMENDATIONS:  Attendant Care:  Based on this assessment, Ms. Pasqua is currently not in need of Attendant Care for the  management of he r core daily self - care functions.   No Form 1 has been completed at this time.  Housekeeping:  While Ms. Pasqua is   physically able to engage in   housekeeping activities , her mental health has  severely impacted her ability to engage in pre - accident housekeeping tasks as a result of lack of  motivation, low energy levels a nd severe anxiety. She would at this time benefit from   ?? hours  per week   of housekeeping assistance to help manage those   housekeeping   functions she   is no  longer performing.  Assistive Devices:  There are no assistive devices currently indicated to further Ms. Pasqua ’ s functional recovery   at  this time.  Further   Occupational Therapy Interventions:  Ms. Pa squa would benefit from   Occupational Therapy treatment at this time as indicated above.

Referral for Other Services:  There are no referrals indicated at this time .\n\nDate of Report:   2021 - 03 - 31  ______________________________________________________________________________  Christina   Pasqua   Claim #:   5030704357   Page   4   of   14  INFORMED   CONSENT   STATEMENT :  This therapist has reviewed issues related to consent as per the requirements outlined by the  College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario:  •   A n   occupational therapy assessment is to be conducted by this therapist, a registered  occupational therapist with the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario (COTO).  •   The assessment has been requested by   her legal representative Frank McNally of McNally  Gervan   Law Firm.  •   The purpose of this assessment is to assess   Ms. Pasqua ’ s   current functional status as it  relates to   the   ability to complete the reported pre - accident activities of daily living.  •   The proposed assessment will in clude: an interview, a physical assessment and also  observations of   the   ability to complete functional tasks within and around the home as well  as education on safe means of completing activities of daily living if required.  •   Due to the physical nature of t he assessment, pain and fatigue are possible temporary side  effects.  •   Recommendations   may   be   provided   at   the   conclusion   of   the   assessment.
