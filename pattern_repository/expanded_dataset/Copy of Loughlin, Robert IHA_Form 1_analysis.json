As per the OSOT Guidelines, “this assessment of Attendant Care Needs (Form 1) is not simply the recording of what attendant care services are already in place. [This therapist’s] role is to determine the extent to which the client can perform the skills and activities identified in the Form 1 safely, functionally, and to objectively identify what assistance if any is needed from the present time into the future until another such re-assessment may identify modified needs.” \n\n\n\nPart 1 – Level 1 Attendant Care (Routine personal care)\n\n\n\nTask\n\nObservations/Comments\n\nWeekly Time Allotted\n\nDress\n\nUpper body\n\nLower Body\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nUndress\n\nUpper body\n\nLower Body\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nProsthetics\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nOrthotics\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nGrooming\n\nFace\n\nHands\n\nShaving\n\nCosmetics\n\nBrush/shampoo/dry/style hair\n\nFingernails\n\nToenails\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nFeeding\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nMobility *\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nExtra Laundering\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\n* Please note that as per the guidelines set forth by the Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists, assistance with mobility includes “all transfers both inside the home and out in the community” and “supervision and assistance when walking includes: stair climbing, mobility on ramps, into and out of home and/or lobby, garage, in the community etc.”\n\n\n\nPart 2 – Level 2 Attendant Care (Basic supervisory functions)\n\n\n\nTask\n\nObservations/Comments\n\nWeekly Time Allotted\n\nHygiene *\n\nClean tub/shower/ sink after use\n\nChange bedding, make bed, clean room\n\nEnsure comfort and safety (bedroom)\n\nAssist in daily wearing apparel\n\nHand/sort clothes to be laundered\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nBasic Supervisory Care **\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nCo-ordination of Attendant Care\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\n\n\n* The “Assessment of Attendant Care Needs” guidelines set forth by the Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists considers “supervisory functions for those who are emotionally, cognitively and/or physically in need of comfort (e.g. advocating for a child or someone who is cognitively impaired)”. The OSOT guidelines further state that the “family may be ensuring comfort, safety and security in this (hospital) environment and these activities should be considered an attendant care need under Level 2”.\n\n\n\n** As per the National Research Counsel of Canada (2006), the Available Safe Escape Time (ASET) for a single-family house equipped with smoke alarms, may only be 3 minutes. The Required Safe Escape Time (RSET) is the amount of time required for an individual to evacuate or reach an area of safety. Factors that impact the ability to evacuate quickly include age, sleep stage (those in deep stages have more difficulty being roused), drugs (e.g.,\n\nindividuals taking a sleeping aid} and alcohol consumption, and those who have physical and mental disabilities. In Canada, winter conditions must also be considered, as “preparation for further action” activities including donning boots and coats, and gathering belongings, require additional time.\n\n\n\nPart 3 – Level 3 Attendant Care (Complex health/care and hygiene functions)\n\n\n\nTask\n\nObservations/Comments\n\nWeekly Time Allotted\n\nGenitourinary Tracts\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nBowel Care\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nTracheostomy\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nVentilator Care\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nSkin Care\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nMedication\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nBathing\n\nBathtub or shower\n\nBed bath\n\nOral Hygiene (including dentures)\n\nTransfer, bathing and drying, prep equipment, clean equipment, apply creams, etc.\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nOther Therapy (TENS, DCS)\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nMaintenance of Equipment and Supplies\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nSkilled Supervisory Care (for aggressive or violent behaviour)\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendant Care Calculation:\n\n\n\nPart 1\t-  Routine Personal Care\t\t\t0 hours per week \t\t$0 /month\n\nPart 2 \t-  Basic Supervisory Functions\t\t0 hours per week \t    \t$0 /month\n\nPart 3\t-  Complex Health/Care and Hygiene\t\t0 hours per week \t\t$0 /month\n\n\n\nTotal monthly assessed attendant care benefit:  $ (subject to limits under Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule)\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOSING COMMENTS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis therapist may be contacted through the offices of FERLAND & ASSOCIATES REHABILITATION INC. at 613-204-1549 or by email at ferland@ferlandassociates.com .\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________\n\nSebastien Ferland OT Reg.(Ont)\n\n\n\nEncl:  \tForm 1\n\n\n\nCc:\tLF\n\n\tInsurer\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\nAn electronic signature was used in order to assist with a timely report.
