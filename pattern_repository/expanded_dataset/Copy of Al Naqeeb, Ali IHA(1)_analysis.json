His professional practice began in 1998 when he graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Ottawa and launched himself in the world of private business.  Over the years, he has provided services to the automobile insurance and legal communities as well the WSIB, Veterans Affairs and the Long-Term Disability sector.\n\n\n\nMr. Ferland has extensive experience working with individuals suffering from catastrophic injuries.  He provides assessment and treatment services as a primary Occupational Therapist as well as a Case Manager for individuals who sustained traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and amputations.  He also has extensive experience working with individuals who have been deemed to meet the catastrophic threshold on the basis of psychological and/or psychiatric impairments.\n\n\n\nOver his years of working with individuals injured in motor vehicle accidents, Mr. Ferland developed a strong interest in the field of mental health, focussed on functional reactivation for injured individuals suffering from depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress.  His clinical acumen has led him to be qualified as an Expert in his field by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.  \n\n\n\n\n\nSTATUS UPDATE:\n\n\n\nSubsequent to the In-Home Assessment completed by this therapist on November 24, 2021, Mr. Alnaqeeb expressed a desire to reconnect in a treatment capacity with this therapist as he felt his situation was deteriorating.  This therapist engaged with Mr. Alnaqeeb in April through August for a total of five sessions.  During this time, the following observations were noted:\n\n\n\nMr. Alnaqeeb presents with significant signs of depression and anxiety which are impacting on his ability to engage in substantially all of his activities of daily living.\n\nHe remains uninvolved in household activities and his home’s exterior appearance is unkept and has led to complaints from his neighbours.\n\nHe continues to struggle with follow-through on all fronts of function which has led to ongoing conflicts with his wife including a separation.  He noted he is now back in the familial home and trying to work on his engagement with the family.\n\nMr. Alnaqeeb repeatedly indicated that “I know I can’t keep working but I don’t know how to present this to my employer, wife, and family.  I need time to figure this out.”\n\nAt work, Mr. Alnaqeeb has been sidelined from his core accounting duties and was mandated to complete French upgrading classes in order to meet ongoing employment requirements.  He has been working one-on-one on a full-time basis with a French teacher over video conferencing from his home office.  He indicated that he is not making any significant progress and is currently repeating modules previously completed as he could not demonstrate knowledge retention.  He is fearful of his employer’s reaction when an update is provided demonstrating his limited progress.  Mr. Alnaqeeb admitted that he often misses classes, takes extended lunches, takes days off and will at times completely zone-out during class time.  He further indicated that he finds his current workplace situation demeaning and not capitalizing on his skills.  \n\nMr. Alnaqeeb presents with a strong belief system stemming from his cultural background which precludes him from showing signs of weakness in relation to his role as a family provider.  To that end, Mr. Alnaqeeb has maintained his engagement in workplace activities despite his significant physical, cognitive, and emotional symptoms.  However, evidence demonstrates that his current employment path is unsustainable and will quite potentially lead to a termination should medical issues not be addressed.  \n\n\n\nIn this therapist’s opinion, the only path at this juncture would be for Mr. Alnaqeeb to take a substantial medical leave from his workplace and engage in his rehabilitation in a focussed and purposeful manner.  He requires a combination of psychological treatment, physical therapy, and engagement in functional reactivation with this therapist to foster meaningful gains in his recovery.  Mr. Alnaqeeb struggles at this present time to partake in meaningful therapy given his limited emotional and cognitive stamina which is being depleted through his work and busy family life.  He noted that he knows he needs to take time off work to look after himself, but he remains “stuck”.  He appears to have a deep-rooted fear of disappointing family and tarnishing his work reputation should he go off work for medical issues.  This therapist will continue to engage with Mr. Alnaqeeb on a regular basis to support him during this difficult time as he plans on how to move forward in his recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nCONTACT:\n\n\n\nThis therapist may be contacted through the offices of FERLAND & ASSOCIATES REHABILITATION INC. at 613-204-1549 or by email at ferland@ferlandassociates.com .\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________\n\nSebastien Ferland OT Reg.(Ont)\n\n\n\nEnclosed:  NA\n\n\t\t\n\nAn electronic signature was used in order to assist with a timely report.
