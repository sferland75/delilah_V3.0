His professional practice began in 1998 when he graduated from the University of Ottawa’s School of Rehabilitation and began working as a registered Occupational Therapist in the private sector.  Over the years, Mr. Ferland has developed his clinical skills and evolved to provide expert opinions in matters of human function  to stakeholders in the automobile insurance sector, personal injury and family law, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB), Veterans Affairs and the Long-Term Disability sectors.

His assessments inform multidisciplinary team members (psychiatry, orthopedics, neurology, physiatry, psychology, etc.) of injured client’s daily functional capabilities at home, work and in the community, assisting them in forming opinions surrounding whether the catastrophic injury threshold is met.  \n\n\n\nMr. Ferland concurrently provides services as a treating Occupational Therapist to clients who have sustained physical and psychological trauma in motor vehicle accidents.  He has extensive experience in providing care to individuals suffering from chronic pain, depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress, overseeing and directing functional reactivation programs to foster improvements in function and participation in meaningful activity. \n\n\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT PREAMBLE:\n\n\n\nMohammed Said, a 37-year-old male, was involved in a motor vehicle collision as a driver on March 23, 2021. This assessment was conducted to evaluate Mr. Said's current functional status and provide recommendations for ongoing care and rehabilitation. The assessment took place at Mr. Said's residence on September 12 and 17, 2024. \n\n\n\nMr. Said sustained injuries to his neck, left shoulder, and lower back as a result of the collision and continues to experience chronic pain symptoms. He also reports cognitive difficulties and emotional changes since the accident. This assessment aims to identify Mr. Said's current functional abilities and limitations, and to recommend appropriate interventions to support his recovery and improve his quality of life.\n\n\n\nAn OCF18 for the completion of this assessment was submitted to the insurer via HCAI and this plan was denied in full, with no explanation available.  Given the urgency of Mr. Said’s situation, this therapist proceeded with completing the assessment as well as provide core stabilization interventions.\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS:\n\n\n\nMr. Mohammed Said is a 37-year-old male who was involved in a motor vehicle collision as a driver on March 23, 2021. As a result of this accident, Mr. Said sustained injuries to his neck, left shoulder, and lower back, leading to chronic pain that continues to significantly impact his daily life. In addition to these physical symptoms, Mr. Said reports experiencing cognitive difficulties and emotional changes since the accident.\n\n\n\nMr. Said's physical symptoms are characterized by severe chronic pain, particularly in his lower back and left shoulder, both of which he rates at 8/10 on a pain scale. He also experiences frequent headaches (5/10) accompanied by sensitivity to light and noise. These symptoms have substantially reduced his physical tolerances. Mr. Said can now only sit for about 30 minutes, stand for 5 minutes, and walk for approximately 300 meters before needing to rest. His lifting capacity has been limited to about 5 pounds due to back and shoulder pain.\n\n\n\nCognitively, Mr. Said reports challenges with short-term memory, attention, and concentration. He experiences slowed processing speed and difficulty with decision-making, planning, and organizing tasks. These cognitive changes have impacted his ability to engage in complex activities and manage his daily responsibilities effectively.\n\n\n\nEmotionally, Mr. Said presents with symptoms of depression and anxiety, including mood swings and increased irritability. He struggles with stress management and emotional regulation. Mr. Said reports a history of panic attacks, with the most recent episode occurring two months ago.\n\n\n\nMr. Said has a history of significant substance abuse issues, which culminated in mid-August 2024.  Mr. Said reports maintaining sobriety since the date of August 14, 2024.   This history of substance abuse has likely compounded the challenges he faces in his recovery from the accident-related injuries.\n\n\n\nMr. Said's injuries and ongoing symptoms have led to substantial changes in his life circumstances. He has been unable to return to his pre-accident employment as a soup cook at Farm Boy, resulting in financial strain. He now relies on ODSP (Ontario Disability Support Program) for income. Mr. Said also experienced a divorce following the accident and has recently obtained housing through Ottawa Housing, with a move-in date of September 23, 2024. This new living situation represents a positive step towards stability in his recovery.\n\n\n\nDespite his limitations, Mr. Said continues to provide care for his two young children, ages 4 and 5, on a part-time basis. He requires assistance from family members for transportation and some daily tasks. His engagement in home management, leisure activities, and social interactions has been significantly reduced due to his physical and cognitive limitations.\n\n\n\nMr. Said's complex presentation, including his physical injuries, cognitive changes, emotional symptoms, and history of substance abuse, necessitates a comprehensive rehabilitation approach. This approach should address his physical limitations, chronic pain management, cognitive functioning, emotional well-being, and substance abuse recovery. The recent improvements in his housing situation and his maintained sobriety provide a foundation for implementing strategies to enhance his overall quality of life and functional independence.\n\n\n\nRecommendations for equipment, therapy services, and other interventions will be outlined in this report to support Mr. Said's ongoing recovery and to enhance his ability to engage in meaningful daily activities, manage his symptoms, and work towards increased independence and well-being.\n\n\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n\n\nAttendant Care:\n\n\n\nHousekeeping:\n\n\n\nAssistive Devices:\n\n\n\nFurther Occupational Therapy Interventions:\n\n\n\nReferral for Other Services:\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT:\n\n\n\nThis therapist has reviewed issues related to consent as per the requirements outlined by the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario:\n\n\n\nAn occupational therapy assessment is to be conducted by this therapist, a registered occupational therapist with the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario (COTO).\n\nThe assessment has been requested by his legal representative, Mr. Frank McNally of McNally Gervan.\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to assess Mr. Said’s current functional status as it relates to his ability to complete pre-accident activities of daily living.\n\nThe proposed assessment will include: an interview, a physical assessment and also observations of the ability to complete functional tasks within and around the home as well as education on safe means of completing activities of daily living if required.\n\nDue to the physical nature of the assessment, pain and fatigue are possible temporary side effects.\n\nRecommendations may be provided at the conclusion of the assessment.  These recommendations may include:\n\nOccupational Therapy Treatment\n\nAssistive Devices\n\nReferral to other practitioners\n\nSupport services\n\nA submission for funding will be submitted to the insurer for any goods and/or services on an OCF18 – Assessment and Treatment Plan.  The insurer may approve or deny the plan (in part or in whole).  Should a denial or partial denial occur, an independent examination by another Occupational Therapist may be requested by the insurer.  This may be an in-person assessment or a remote paper-review assessment.  Funding for the requested goods and/or services may ultimately be declined.\n\nMr. Said may choose to participate or decline any or all of the proposed assessment.\n\nA report documenting this assessment will be completed and copies will be provided to the following parties via secure transmission (fax or encrypted email attachment):\n\nBelair Insurance Company Inc., c/o Sophia Karabinis, Accident Benefits Adjuster\n\nMcNally Gervan, c/o Frank McNally, Legal Representative\n\n\n\nFollowing this therapist’s explanation Mr. Said granted informed consent for this therapist to proceed with the assessment and any subsequent interventions. \n\n\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:\n\n\n\n\n\nHospital Records \n\n\n\nThe Ottawa Hospital \n\n\n\nClinical notes and records from December 12, 2017, to  April 14, 2023\n\nClinical notes and records received July 31, 2024 \n\n\n\nMontfort Hospital \n\n\n\nClinical notes and records from March 23, 2017, to July 3, 2024 \n\n\n\nFamily Doctor \n\n\n\nDr. George Richardson \n\n\n\nClinical notes and records received April 1, 2022 \n\n\n\nTreating Specialists\n\n\n\nFunction ability \n\n\n\nOccupational Therapy Initial Report: In-Home Functional Assessment, dated December 8, 2023 \n\n\n\nApollo Physical Therapy \n\n\n\nClinical notes and records from July 25, 2022, to August 11, 2022 \n\nClinical notes and records from March 03, 2016, to March 08, 2022 \n\nClinical notes and records from March 8, 2022, to June 21, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\n\n\nPrior to the motor vehicle collision on March 23, 2021, Mr. Said reported being in generally good physical health. He was an active individual who prioritized his well-being. However, he did have some pre-existing conditions and a history of mental health challenges:\n\n\n\nBurns: Mr. Said has scarring from past burns on his face and upper body, including his arms and hands, which were sustained in a house fire when he was younger. He made a good recovery from these injuries, noting only limitations with neck extension due to skin tightness and sensitivity to sun and temperature.\n\n\n\nMental Health: Mr. Said has a history of depression, for which he was prescribed antidepressant medication approximately 10 years before the accident. He reports taking this medication on and off for about a year before discontinuing as he was feeling better.\n\n\n\nSubstance Use: Mr. Said has a history of alcohol use disorder. However, he reports having been sober for over 10 years prior to the motor vehicle collision.\n\n\n\nNeck Mobility: Due to the burn injuries, Mr. Said experienced some limitation in neck extension. This pre-existing condition did not significantly impact his daily functioning before the accident.\n\n\n\nOther Medical Conditions: Mr. Said did not report any other significant medical conditions, chronic illnesses, or ongoing health concerns prior to the accident.\n\n\n\nWhile Mr. Said had a history of mental health challenges and substance use, he reports that these were well-managed in the years leading up to the accident. He was functioning independently, maintaining full-time employment, and actively participating in family life without significant limitations from his pre-existing conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\nMECHANISM OF INJURY:\n\nOn March 23, 2021, Mr. Mohammed Said was involved in a motor vehicle collision. At the time of the incident, Mr. Said was the sole occupant and driver of a Kia Forte, and he was wearing a seatbelt. The collision occurred as Mr. Said was driving on Bank Street and had stopped at an intersection. Another vehicle, which had turned right onto Bank Street behind Mr. Said, failed to stop and rear-ended his vehicle.\n\nThe impact caused Mr. Said's chest to strike the steering wheel. However, the collision was not severe enough to deploy the airbags, and Mr. Said's vehicle did not collide with any other vehicles. Police attended the scene, but emergency medical services were not required. Mr. Said and the other driver exchanged information and left the scene.\n\nImmediately following the accident, Mr. Said did not report any symptoms. However, the next day, he experienced significant lower back pain. In response to this pain, Mr. Said consulted his family physician, Dr. George Richardson. Dr. Richardson examined Mr. Said, prescribed pain medication, and recommended physiotherapy. Additionally, Dr. Richardson provided a requisition for x-rays, which Mr. Said had not yet completed at the time of this assessment.\n\nFollowing his doctor's advice, Mr. Said initiated physiotherapy, attending sessions once a week for approximately two months. His condition improved during this period, leading him to discontinue physiotherapy. However, when his lower back pain subsequently returned, Mr. Said resumed physiotherapy at a different facility. \n\n\n\nNATURE OF INJURY:\n\n\n\nBased on a review of available medical documentation, Mr. Said sustained the following injuries as a result of the subject motor vehicle accident:\n\n\n\nConcussion S.06.0\n\nSprain and strain of unspecified part of shoulder girdle S.43.79\n\nSprain and strain of lumbar spine S.33.5\n\nMental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol F.10\n\nDepressive episode F.32\n\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE OF RECOVERY TO DATE:\n\n\n\nFollowing the motor vehicle collision on March 23, 2021, Mr. Mohammed Said's recovery has been complicated by both his accident-related injuries and pre-existing alcohol abuse issues. These factors have led to inconsistent engagement with treatment and periods of unstable living conditions.\n\nMr. Said experienced delayed onset of symptoms, reporting significant lower back pain the day after the collision. He consulted his family physician, Dr. George Richardson, who prescribed pain medication and recommended physiotherapy. Mr. Said attended weekly physiotherapy sessions for approximately two months, reporting some improvement in his condition during this time.\n\nHowever, Mr. Said's alcohol abuse worsened after the accident, leading to periods of homelessness. He resided in a shelter for some time, which negatively impacted his ability to consistently attend medical appointments and rehabilitation sessions.\n\nMr. Said's living situation changed several times during his recovery. After leaving the shelter, he lived with his sister for a period, then moved in with his ex-wife. While living with his ex-wife, Mr. Said maintained a period of sobriety, which coincided with more consistent medical treatment.\n\nThroughout this time, Mr. Said continued to see Dr. Richardson approximately every three weeks. He also received physiotherapy at Apollo once per week and participated in occupational therapy for two months. These treatments were interrupted when Mr. Said traveled to Africa from October to December 2023.\n\nOn August 14, 2024, Mr. Said reports ceasing all substance use. He has maintained sobriety since this date, marking a significant change in his recovery process. On September 23, 2024, Mr. Said moved into an apartment provided by Ottawa Housing, establishing a more stable living environment.\n\nDespite these improvements, Mr. Said continues to experience persistent symptoms. He reports chronic pain in his lower back and left shoulder, frequent headaches, cognitive difficulties including problems with memory and concentration, and emotional issues such as depression and anxiety. These ongoing problems have prevented his return to pre-accident employment. Mr. Said currently receives Ontario Disability Support Program (ODSP) benefits.\n\nMr. Said's recovery has been significantly influenced by the interplay between his physical injuries, mental health issues, substance abuse, and housing instability. While he has recently achieved sobriety and stable housing, he continues to face substantial challenges related to his accident injuries. These recent positive changes may provide a foundation for more consistent engagement with treatment moving forward.\n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICAL/REHABILITATION TEAM:\n\n\n\nHealth Professional Name and Specialty\n\nDate of Last Appointment/ Frequency of appointments\n\nOutcome of Last Appointment\n\nDate of Next Appointment\n\nDr. George Richardson, GP\n\n2 months ago\n\nChecking on client, renewed medication for pain.

He endorses symptoms of depression and anxiety, including frequent mood swings and increased irritability. Mr. Said describes having difficulty managing stress and regulating his emotions. He reports a history of panic attacks, with the most recent episode occurring two months prior to this assessment.\n\nMr. Said's emotional state is characterized by quick shifts to anger, though he notes these episodes typically resolve within about 5 minutes. He expresses feeling overwhelmed by daily activities and having difficulty coping with challenges. Mr. Said reports sudden outbursts of anger, though he denies any episodes of crying since achieving sobriety.\n\nIt's noteworthy that Mr. Said has a history of substance abuse, particularly alcohol, which culminated on August 14, 2024. Since that date, he reports maintaining sobriety, which may be positively influencing his emotional stability.\n\n\n\nCognitive Symptoms:\n\nMr. Said reports experiencing several cognitive symptoms since the accident. He endorses difficulties with short-term memory, often misplacing objects and forgetting appointments. While his long-term memory appears intact, he struggles with remembering recent events and information.\n\nAttention and concentration are significant areas of concern for Mr. Said. He reports difficulty maintaining focus and completing tasks. His processing speed has slowed, noting that he often takes longer to understand what is being said to him and to respond in conversations.\n\nMr. Said also experiences challenges with executive functioning. He reports difficulty with planning and organizing tasks, as well as making decisions. Problem-solving in everyday situations has become more challenging for him.\n\nMental fatigue is a significant issue for Mr. Said. He reports feeling mentally exhausted after short periods of cognitive activity and feeling overwhelmed by complex tasks.\n\nThese cognitive symptoms, combined with his physical pain and emotional challenges, significantly impact Mr. Said's daily functioning and quality of life. They affect his ability to manage household tasks, engage in social activities, and consider return-to-work options.\n\n\n\nSymptom Management Strategies:\n\nMr. Said reported making use of the following strategies to manage his symptoms:\n\nMedication: Takes Tylenol as needed for pain management.\n\nSocial interaction: Goes to Tim Hortons to engage in conversation, which helps distract from symptoms.\n\nOutdoor activities: Spends time with his children at the park, which provides both physical activity and emotional support.\n\nRest: Uses periods of rest to manage fatigue and pain.\n\n\n\nFUNCTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL OBSERVATIONS:\n\n\n\nTolerances, Mobility and Transfers: \n\n\n\nActivity\n\nClient Report and Therapist Observations\n\nSitting and repositioning\n\n30 minutes then has to change position.\n\nBed mobility\n\nDifficulty repositioning himself due to pain.\n\nTransfers\n\nIndependent\n\nStanding\n\n5 minutes then must sit down.

[This therapist’s] role is to determine the extent to which the client can perform the skills and activities identified in the Form 1 safely, functionally, and to objectively identify what assistance if any is needed from the present time into the future until another such re-assessment may identify modified needs.” \n\n\n\nPart 1 – Level 1 Attendant Care (Routine personal care)\n\n\n\nTask\n\nObservations/Comments\n\nWeekly Time Allotted\n\nDress\n\nUpper body\n\nLower Body\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nUndress\n\nUpper body\n\nLower Body\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nProsthetics\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nOrthotics\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nGrooming\n\nFace\n\nHands\n\nShaving\n\nCosmetics\n\nBrush/shampoo/dry/style hair\n\nFingernails\n\nToenails\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nFeeding\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nMobility *\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nExtra Laundering\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\n* Please note that as per the guidelines set forth by the Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists, assistance with mobility includes “all transfers both inside the home and out in the community” and “supervision and assistance when walking includes: stair climbing, mobility on ramps, into and out of home and/or lobby, garage, in the community etc.”\n\n\n\nPart 2 – Level 2 Attendant Care (Basic supervisory functions)\n\n\n\nTask\n\nObservations/Comments\n\nWeekly Time Allotted\n\nHygiene *\n\nClean tub/shower/ sink after use\n\nChange bedding, make bed, clean room\n\nEnsure comfort and safety (bedroom)\n\nAssist in daily wearing apparel\n\nHand/sort clothes to be laundered\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nBasic Supervisory Care **\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nCo-ordination of Attendant Care\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\n\n\n* The “Assessment of Attendant Care Needs” guidelines set forth by the Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists considers “supervisory functions for those who are emotionally, cognitively and/or physically in need of comfort (e.g. advocating for a child or someone who is cognitively impaired)”. The OSOT guidelines further state that the “family may be ensuring comfort, safety and security in this (hospital) environment and these activities should be considered an attendant care need under Level 2”.\n\n\n\n** As per the National Research Counsel of Canada (2006), the Available Safe Escape Time (ASET) for a single-family house equipped with smoke alarms, may only be 3 minutes. The Required Safe Escape Time (RSET) is the amount of time required for an individual to evacuate or reach an area of safety. Factors that impact the ability to evacuate quickly include age, sleep stage (those in deep stages have more difficulty being roused), drugs (e.g.,\n\nindividuals taking a sleeping aid} and alcohol consumption, and those who have physical and mental disabilities. In Canada, winter conditions must also be considered, as “preparation for further action” activities including donning boots and coats, and gathering belongings, require additional time.\n\n\n\nPart 3 – Level 3 Attendant Care (Complex health/care and hygiene functions)\n\n\n\nTask\n\nObservations/Comments\n\nWeekly Time Allotted\n\nGenitourinary Tracts\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nBowel Care\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nTracheostomy\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nVentilator Care\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nExercise\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nSkin Care\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nMedication\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nBathing\n\nBathtub or shower\n\nBed bath\n\nOral Hygiene (including dentures)\n\nTransfer, bathing and drying, prep equipment, clean equipment, apply creams, etc.\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nOther Therapy (TENS, DCS)\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nMaintenance of Equipment and Supplies\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nSkilled Supervisory Care (for aggressive or violent behaviour)\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\n\n\n\n\nAttendant Care Calculation:\n\n\n\nPart 1\t-  Routine Personal Care\t\t\t0 hours per week \t\t$0 /month\n\nPart 2 \t-  Basic Supervisory Functions\t\t0 hours per week \t    \t$0 /month\n\nPart 3\t-  Complex Health/Care and Hygiene\t\t0 hours per week \t\t$0 /month\n\n\n\nTotal monthly assessed attendant care benefit:  $ (subject to limits under Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule)\n\n\n\n\n\nCLOSING COMMENTS:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis therapist may be contacted through the offices of FERLAND & ASSOCIATES REHABILITATION INC. at 613-204-1549 or by email at ferland@ferlandassociates.com .\n\n\n\nSincerely,\n\n\n\n\n\n_______________________\n\nSebastien Ferland OT Reg.(Ont)\n\n\n\nEncl:  \tForm 1\n\n\n\nCc:\tLF\n\n\tInsurer\t\t\n\n\t\t\n\nAn electronic signature was used in order to assist with a timely report.
