His professional practice began in 1998 when he graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Ottawa and launched himself in the world of private business.  Over the years, Sebastien has provided services to the automobile insurance and legal communities as well the WSIB, Veterans Affairs and the Long-Term Disability sector.\n\n\n\nSebastien has extensive experience working with individuals suffering from catastrophic injuries.  He provides assessment and treatment services as a primary Occupational Therapist as well as a Case Manager for individuals who sustained traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and amputations.  He also has extensive experience working with individuals who have been deemed to meet the catastrophic threshold on the basis of psychological and/or psychiatric impairments.\n\n\n\nOver his years of working with individuals injured in motor vehicle accidents, Sebastien developed a strong interest in the field of mental health, focussed on functional reactivation for injured individuals suffering from depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress.  His clinical acumen has led him to be qualified as an Expert in his field by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.  \n\nPURPOSE OF REFERRAL:\n\n\n\nTo perform an assessment with respect to Mr. El-Jammal’s ability to manage those functional activities Mr. El-Jammal was responsible for prior to the motor vehicle accident of 2017-12-12.\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS:\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal is a 45 year old man of Lebanese descent who was involved in a car accident on December 12, 2017.  He was riding as a passenger when the vehicle he was riding in was rear-ended by a pickup truck equipped with a snow removal blade while slowing down during poor weather conditions.  The vehicle was reportedly pushed off the road and into a deep 8’ ditch.  Mr. El-Jammal reported struck his head on the side pillar of the passenger window resulting in a loss of consciousness of indeterminate duration.  Mr. El-Jammal was taken by ambulance to the Ottawa General Hospital where he was seen in the Emergency Room and released the next day.  He was cleared for any fractures or internal injuries and released to the care of his family physician, Dr. Robert.\n\n\n\nSince the accident, Mr. El-Jammal has experienced severe pain symptoms affecting his neck and lower back as well as neurological symptoms affecting his right shoulder, right arm and right leg.  He has also experienced concussive symptoms which include severe daily headaches, hypersensitivity to light and decreased cognitive function.  Mr. El-Jammal is currently experiencing acute emotional distress and reported some suicidal ideation. \n\n\n\nFrom a functional perspective, Mr. El-Jammal has been unable to manage any of his pre-accident workplace activities.  He worked as a pizza restaurant manager and cook, working upwards of 70 – 80 hours per week.  He is currently experiencing significant financial strain leading to his imminent eviction from his apartment.  He has been financially supported by friends up until recently when his friends told him they could no longer continue lending him money.  He will reportedly be moving in with his friend upon eviction where he plans on continuing his recovery.\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal requires significant Attendant Care at this time due to a combination of psychological and physical symptoms.  He is also unable to manage any of his housekeeping functions and would also benefit from housekeeping assistance at this time.\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal would strongly benefit from a multi-disciplinary approach to his injuries which should include physical therapy, psychology and occupational therapy.  He has reportedly undergone a psychological assessment recently and hopes to begin treatment as soon as possible.  An OCF18 for the provision of an initial block of Occupational Therapy will be submitted to the insurer for consideration.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n\n\nAttendant Care:\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal is currently in need of significant amounts of Attendant Care as a result of his severe pain symptoms (and associated physical impairments) and of his current psychological presentation.  He would at this time benefit from approximately 131 hours of Attendant Care per month totaling a monthly Attendant Care benefit of $2387.81.\n\n\n\nHousekeeping:\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal is currently unable to contribute to any form of housekeeping or home maintenance as a result of his significant physical impairments.  He would benefit from 7.92 hours per week of housekeeping assistance.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistive Devices:\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal would benefit from the use of the following assistive devices to promote safety during bathing/showering activities:\n\n\n\nGrab bars\n\nBath seat\n\nTelephone shower head\n\n\n\nThe provision of these devices was discussed with Mr. El-Jammal who indicated that he did not believe it would be practical to acquire them until he moved to his friend’s home.  He is facing imminent eviction from his apartment and wishes to wait for his move to occur before moving forward with assistive device implementation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Occupational Therapy Interventions:\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal would benefit from Occupational Therapy services at this time to assist him with integrating meaningful activity in his daily routine as well as to reduce his level of dependency on his friends to manage his difficult situation.  An OCF18 will be submitted for an initial block of 6 treatment sessions for consideration by the insurer.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferral for Other Services:\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal would benefit from interventions from a multi-disciplinary team of providers including physical therapy and psychological care.  Referrals for these services have already been made and treatment initiation is under way based on this this assessment with Mr. El-Jammal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT:\n\n\n\nThis therapist has reviewed issues related to consent as per the requirements outlined by the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario:\n\n\n\nAn occupational therapy assessment is to be conducted by this therapist, a registered occupational therapist with the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario (COTO).\n\nThe assessment has been requested by his legal representative, Mr. Frank McNally of the law offices of McNally Gervan.\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to assess Mr. El-Jammal’s current functional status as it relates to his ability to complete his reported pre-accident activities of daily living.\n\nThe proposed assessment will include: an interview, a physical assessment and also observations of the ability to complete functional tasks within and around the home as well as education on safe means of completing activities of daily living if required.\n\nDue to the physical nature of the assessment, pain and fatigue are possible temporary side effects.\n\nRecommendations may be provided at the conclusion of the assessment.  These recommendations may include:\n\nOccupational Therapy Treatment\n\nAssistive Devices\n\nReferral to other practitioners\n\nSupport services\n\nA submission for funding will be submitted to the insurer for any goods and/or services on an OCF18 – Assessment and Treatment Plan.  The insurer may approve or deny the plan (in part or in whole).  Should a denial or partial denial occur, an independent examination by another Occupational Therapist may be requested by the insurer.  This may be an in-person assessment or a remote paper-review assessment.  Funding for the requested goods and/or services may ultimately be declined.\n\nMr. El-Jammal may choose to participate or decline any or all of the proposed assessment.\n\nA report documenting this assessment will be completed and copies will be provided to the following parties via secure transmission (fax or encrypted email attachment):\n\nCoseco Insurance, c/o Brigitte Gratton, Adjuster\n\nMcNally Gervan, c/o Frank McNally\n\n\n\nFollowing this therapist’s explanation Mr. El-Jammal granted informed consent for this therapist to proceed with the assessment and any subsequent interventions. \n\n\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:\n\n\n\nThere was no documentation available for review at the time of this In-Home Assessment. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal was in excellent physical health prior to the accident.  He worked full-time hours as a pizza restaurant manager and cook, often exceeding 70 – 80 hours per week.  He did report a childhood history of trauma during his time living in Lebanon.  \n\n\n\nIn 1982, when Mr. El-Jammal was 9 years old, he reported that the building he lived in was hit by mortar shells.  He was hit in the chest by shrapnel and Israeli soldiers picked him up and provided medical attention.  He remained in Israel for 4 months where he recovered and returned home to his parent’s care.  He reported a history of bad dreams and hypervigilance following this incident.  He is sensitive to airplane noises and balloons popping, etc.  These symptoms remained present at the time of the subject motor vehicle accident but were however flared significantly.\n\n\n\n\n\nMECHANISM OF INJURY:\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal reported being a passenger in a car driven by his friend “Mo”.  The driver was trying to slow down due to blowing snow and was rear-ended by a pickup truck equipped with a snow removal blade.  The car was pushed into a ditch of approximately 8 feet in depth.  Mr. El-Jammal reported hitting his head on the side pillar of the passenger window.  He lost consciousness for an indeterminate period of time.  He was taken by ambulance to the Ottawa General Hospital where he was treated for his injuries.  He remained in the hospital overnight and was released to the care of his GP (Dr. Robert @ Greenboro Family).    He saw his physician a few days later.  He was sent for repeat x-rays and was provided with medication.  He was referred to physiotherapy and chiropractic care in addition to massage. He is now attending Apollo Physical Therapy Centres 2 – 3 time per week.  \n\n\n\n\n\nNATURE OF INJURY:\n\n\n\nBased on this assessment, Mr. El-Jammal is believed to have sustained the following injuries as  a result of the subject motor vehicle accident.  Please note that this therapist cannot provide diagnoses within his scope of practice and hence the following are potential diagnoses provided for the purposes of highlighting areas of concern expressed by Mr. El-Jammal.  These diagnoses require confirmation from appropriate medical professionals including Mr. El-Jammal’s family physician and a psychologist.\n\n\n\nPossible concussion\n\nSprain and strain of cervical spine\n\nSprain and strain of lumbar spine\n\nAnxiety and depression\n\nPotential aggravation of pre-existing Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE OF RECOVERY TO DATE:\n\n\n\nSince the subject motor vehicle accident, Mr. El-Jammal reported the following course of recovery:\n\n\n\nHe saw his family physician shortly following the accident and was prescribed medication and provided a prescription for physiotherapy.  He is now attending Apollo Physical Therapy Centres two to three times weekly.\n\nHe has been referred to Dr. Nahas of the Seeker’s Centre for pain management interventions.\n\nHe was assessed by a psychologist at the request of his legal representative.  Mr. El-Jammal could not recall the name of the psychologist who assessed him.\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal remains highly symptomatic, both physically and psychologically and he presented in a state of acute psychological distress throughout this assessment.  His friend Mo was present during this assessment and provided Mr. El-Jammal with emotional support while corroborating many of the issues and concerns identified by Mr. El-Jammal.  It was clear from this assessment that Mr. El-Jammal is in need of significant interventions at this time and would benefit from a cohesive multi-disciplinary treatment approach to foster improvements. \n\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICAL/REHABILITATION TEAM:\n\n\n\nHealth Professional Name and Specialty\n\nDate of Last Appointment/ Frequency of appointments\n\nOutcome of Last Appointment\n\nDate of Next Appointment\n\nApollo Physical Therapy Centres (Physiotherapy, Massage and Chiropractic Care)\n\n2 – 3 times per week.\n\nOngoing provision of care.\n\nOngoing\n\nDr. Robert, GP, Greenboro Family Medicine Centre\n\nSeen his GP once since the subject accident.\n\nPrescription for medication and for physiotherapy provided.\n\nTBD\n\n\n\n\n\nMEDICATION:\n\n\n\nMedication Name\n\nDosage/Frequency\n\nPurpose\n\nPregabalin\n\n25 mg\n\nNeuropathic pain and anxiety\n\nOsemeprazole\n\n500/20\n\nAcid reflux\n\nDuloxetine\n\n30 mg\n\nDepression and anxiety\n\n\n\nMr. El-Jammal reported that he has not been taking his prescribed medications as recommended by his family physician.

He could not recall specific dates of events from his medical history and could not recall the names of individuals who are working with him in a treatment capacity.  He was observed to have poor levels of focus and concentration and this therapist was required to intervene on several occasions to bring him back onto the topic of conversation.  His cognitive difficulties are indicative of potential concussion-related impairment, psychological difficulties or likely a combination of the two factors based on his mechanism of injury which included a trauma to the head followed by a period of loss of consciousness.  This will require additional medical investigation to clearly outline the cause of these issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT:\n\n\n\n\n\nTYPE OF DWELLING\n\nApartment located on the second level of a convenience store plaza.

    "ADLS": "Prior to the subject motor vehicle accident, Mr. El-Jammal reported being independent in his management of all self-care activities.\n\nAt the time of this assessment, Mr. El-Jammal reported that he remains independent in his performance of core self-care functions.

    "MEDICAL_HISTORY": "Mr. El-Jammal presented with signs of cognitive impairment apparent through his difficulty recalling words in both English and Arabic.  He could not recall specific dates of events from his medical history and could not recall the names of individuals who are working with him in a treatment capacity.  He was observed to have poor levels of focus and concentration and this therapist was required to intervene on several occasions to bring him back onto the topic of conversation.  His cognitive difficulties are indicative of potential concussion-related impairment, psychological difficulties or likely a combination of the two factors based on his mechanism of injury which included a trauma to the head followed by a period of loss of consciousness.  This will require additional medical investigation to clearly outline the cause of these issues."

He could not recall specific dates of events from his medical history and could not recall the names of individuals who are working with him in a treatment capacity.  He was observed to have poor levels of focus and concentration and this therapist was required to intervene on several occasions to bring him back onto the topic of conversation.  His cognitive difficulties are indicative of potential concussion-related impairment, psychological difficulties or likely a combination of the two factors based on his mechanism of injury which included a trauma to the head followed by a period of loss of consciousness.  This will require additional medical investigation to clearly outline the cause of these issues.",
