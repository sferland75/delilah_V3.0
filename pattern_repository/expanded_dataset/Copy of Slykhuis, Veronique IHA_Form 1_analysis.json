His professional practice began in 1998 when he graduated from the University of Ottawa’s School of Rehabilitation and began working as a registered Occupational Therapist in the private sector.  Over the years, Mr. Ferland has developed his clinical skills and evolved to provide expert opinions in matters of human function  to stakeholders in the automobile insurance sector, personal injury and family law, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB), Veterans Affairs and the Long-Term Disability sectors.  His opinions are sought by both plaintiff and defense counsel in the context of resolving matters in personal injury and family law cases.  He has been qualified several times as an expert in his field, providing testimony under oath in FSCO tribunals and cases appearing before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.  \n\n\n\nMr. Ferland’s practice includes regular contributions to catastrophic designation assessment teams where he provides opinions related to daily function of individuals suffering from serious physical, psychological and cognitive impairments.  His assessments inform multidisciplinary team members (psychiatry, orthopedics, neurology, physiatry, psychology, etc.) of injured client’s daily functional capabilities at home, work and in the community, assisting them in forming opinions surrounding whether the catastrophic injury threshold is met.  \n\n\n\nMr. Ferland concurrently provides services as a treating Occupational Therapist to clients who have sustained physical and psychological trauma in motor vehicle accidents.  He has extensive experience in providing care to individuals suffering from chronic pain, depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress, overseeing and directing functional reactivation programs to foster improvements in function and participation in meaningful activity. \n\n\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT PREAMBLE:\n\n\n\nThis in-home assessment was conducted to evaluate Ms. Veronique Slykhuis's current functional abilities and limitations following injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision on August 26, 2023. The assessment was requested by her legal representative, Mr. Paul Mooney of Badre Law Professional Corporation, to:\n\n\n\nComplete an updated in-home assessment addressing current functional status\n\nEvaluate ongoing attendant care needs\n\nProvide recommendations regarding additional occupational therapy services and equipment needs\n\nIdentify other services that may assist in recovery\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS:\n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis is a 50-year-old woman who was involved in a motor vehicle collision as a passenger on August 26, 2023. The collision occurred when another vehicle struck their car at high speed, causing it to spin and land in a ditch. As a result of the collision, Ms. Slykhuis sustained serious injuries including left breast hematomas requiring surgical aspiration, rib fracture, sternal fracture, and a reported left breast tear (pending confirmation).\n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis continues to present with severe physical, cognitive and psycho-emotional symptoms that significantly impact her daily functioning. Her physical symptoms include severe chest pain and pressure (6-10/10) with burning sensation and pulling from shoulder to shoulder, radiating pain from lower back to leg when walking, limited mobility requiring cane support, significant fatigue, and balance impairment requiring use of supports during transfers. Her sleep is significantly disrupted due to both pain and anxiety.\n\n\n\nCognitively, Ms. Slykhuis demonstrates impairments in memory (particularly for recent events), attention and concentration, processing speed, word-finding, and executive functioning affecting her ability to plan and organize daily activities. These cognitive changes significantly impact her independence and safety with daily tasks.\n\n\n\nFrom a psycho-emotional perspective, Ms. Slykhuis presents with increased anxiety (particularly related to vehicles and driving), depression symptoms including low mood and social withdrawal, post-traumatic stress symptoms including nightmares and flashbacks of the accident, and significant social isolation. She becomes tearful when discussing the accident and its impact on her life. Her emotional state has led to substantial withdrawal from previously enjoyed activities and social interactions.\n\n\n\nPrior to the accident, Ms. Slykhuis maintained full-time employment as a Customer Support Coordinator with the Standards Council of Canada (remote position) and part-time employment as a cashier at Independent Grocer. She has been unable to return to either position due to her ongoing symptoms and functional limitations. The loss of employment has created additional financial strain and emotional distress.\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n\n\nAttendant Care based on the Form 1 assessment completed as part of this evaluation, Ms. Slykhuis continues to require attendant care services totaling $2,150.40 per month. A detailed breakdown is provided in the accompanying Form 1 and narrative section below.\n\n\n\nAssistive Devices The following items are recommended to promote safety and independence:\n\nFront-closure mastectomy/post-surgical bras (2) for breast support and pain management\n\nAdditional grab bars for bathroom (2) to improve safety with transfers\n\nReacher with rotating head to reduce demands on upper body during reaching tasks\n\nLong-handled bath sponge to improve independence with bathing\n\nAnti-slip bath mat to reduce fall risk\n\n\n\nOccupational Therapy Services Based on Ms. Slykhuis's current presentation and ongoing functional challenges, 12 occupational therapy sessions are recommended over 12 weeks to address:\n\nPain management and energy conservation strategies\n\nCognitive compensatory strategies for memory, attention and executive functioning\n\nGradual return to meaningful activities using pacing and planning\n\nHome safety and fall prevention\n\nSleep hygiene strategies\n\nCommunity reintegration, starting with short, supported outings\n\nReturn to work planning and preparation when appropriate\n\n\n\nOther Services\n\n\n\nPhysiotherapy: Continuation of home-based physiotherapy to address ongoing pain, mobility limitations and deconditioning\n\nSocial Work/Psychology: Ongoing psychological support to address post-traumatic stress symptoms, anxiety, and depression\n\nSpeech Language Pathology: Assessment and treatment of cognitive-communication difficulties\n\nRehabilitation Support Worker: one weekly session of 3 hours to assist with implementation of therapy recommendations and community reintegration\n\nCase Management: To coordinate the multidisciplinary team and ensure effective communication between providers\n\n\n\nIt is noteworthy that Ms. Slykhuis presents with a level of impairment that should necessitate consideration for CAT designation.  This therapist will include comments to that effect at the conclusion of this report.\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT:\n\n\n\nThis therapist has reviewed issues related to consent as per the requirements outlined by the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario:\n\n\n\nAn occupational therapy assessment is to be conducted by this therapist, a registered occupational therapist with the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario (COTO).\n\nThe assessment has been requested by her legal representative Mr. Paul Mooney of Badre Law.\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to assess Ms. Slykhuis’ current functional status as it relates to his ability to complete pre-accident activities of daily living.\n\nThe proposed assessment will include: an interview, a physical assessment and also observations of the ability to complete functional tasks within and around the home as well as education on safe means of completing activities of daily living if required.\n\nDue to the physical nature of the assessment, pain and fatigue are possible temporary side effects.\n\nRecommendations may be provided at the conclusion of the assessment.  These recommendations may include:\n\nOccupational Therapy Treatment\n\nAssistive Devices\n\nReferral to other practitioners\n\nSupport services\n\nA submission for funding will be submitted to the insurer for any goods and/or services on an OCF18 – Assessment and Treatment Plan.  The insurer may approve or deny the plan (in part or in whole).  Should a denial or partial denial occur, an independent examination by another Occupational Therapist may be requested by the insurer.  This may be an in-person assessment or a remote paper-review assessment.  Funding for the requested goods and/or services may ultimately be declined.\n\nMs. Slykhuis may choose to participate or decline any or all of the proposed assessment.\n\nA report documenting this assessment will be completed and copies will be provided to the following parties via secure transmission (fax or encrypted email attachment):\n\nDefinity Insurance Company\n\nPaul Mooney, Legal Representative\n\n\n\nFollowing this therapist’s explanation Ms. Slykhuis  granted informed consent for this therapist to proceed with the assessment and any subsequent interventions. \n\n\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:\n\n\n\nA complete list of documents reviewed is available upon request.

Her pre-existing conditions were well-managed and did not significantly impact her daily functioning at the time of the accident.\n\n\n\nMECHANISM OF INJURY:\n\n\n\nOn August 26, 2023, Ms. Slykhuis was a belted passenger in a vehicle that was struck at high speed by another vehicle. The impact occurred on the passenger side, causing their vehicle to spin before landing in a ditch. Ms. Slykhuis has limited recall of the incident itself but remembers gripping tightly to the left side with both hands, opening her eyes to find herself in the ditch, and experiencing severe chest pain. Her 17-year-old son attended the scene. She was assessed by emergency services and transported to Cornwall Community Hospital.\n\n\n\n\n\nNATURE OF INJURY:\n\n\n\nBased on medical documentation reviewed and client report, Ms. Slykhuis sustained the following injuries as a result of the subject motor vehicle accident:\n\nLeft breast traumatic injury with multifocal hematomas requiring surgical aspiration\n\nDisplaced left rib fracture\n\nUndisplaced mid-sternal fracture\n\n\n\nCOURSE OF RECOVERY TO DATE:\n\n\n\nFollowing initial assessment at Cornwall Community Hospital, Ms. Slykhuis was discharged home with pain medication. Due to ongoing severe symptoms, she returned to hospital on September 1, 2023, where imaging revealed the extent of her injuries. She underwent surgical consultation and subsequent breast aspiration on September 13, 2023. The smaller hematomas could not be aspirated and were expected to take 6-8 months to resolve.\n\n\n\nHer recovery has been complicated by:\n\nSevere ongoing pain limiting mobility and function\n\nDevelopment of significant anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms\n\nCognitive changes affecting memory and executive function\n\nSleep disruption due to pain and nightmares\n\nSocial isolation and withdrawal\n\nInability to return to work\n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis has received the following treatments:\n\nPersonal Support Worker services for assistance with daily activities\n\nOccupational Therapy assessment and treatment\n\nPsychological assessment\n\nFollow-up with psychiatrist Dr. Ahmed for management of mental health symptoms\n\nFamily physician monitoring\n\nSleep medicine consultation\n\n\n\nDespite these interventions, Ms. Slykhuis continues to experience significant functional limitations and has not returned to her pre-accident level of function.\n\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICAL/REHABILITATION TEAM:\n\n\n\nHealth Professional Name and Specialty\n\nDate of Last Appointment/ Frequency of appointments\n\nOutcome of Last Appointment\n\nDate of Next Appointment\n\nDr. Sophie Gathier\n\nEvery 2 months\n\nMonitoring pain management and overall recovery.\n\nTBD\n\nPhysiatrist, Dr. Jacob Boomgarth\n\nSaw him over the summer of 2024..

At Thanksgiving dinner, could not see food on her plate.   Has difficulty reading written material.\n\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive Symptoms:\n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis reports significant changes in her cognitive functioning since the accident. Her memory has been notably affected - she struggles to recall details of the accident itself and subsequent medical appointments, frequently forgets daily tasks and conversations, and has difficulty maintaining her medication schedule despite using bubble packs. She describes needing to write things down immediately to avoid forgetting important information.\n\nHer attention and concentration have been significantly impacted. She finds herself easily overwhelmed by multiple stimuli and has difficulty maintaining focus during conversations or while watching television. These difficulties are particularly pronounced when her pain levels are elevated. She notes that her processing speed has slowed considerably - she requires more time to understand and respond to questions, complete familiar tasks, and process written information.\n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis describes substantial challenges with executive functioning, manifesting as difficulties planning and organizing daily activities, managing appointments, making decisions, and solving even simple household problems. She notes that tasks requiring multiple steps have become particularly challenging and she often struggles to initiate activities independently.\n\nHer communication abilities have also been affected. She frequently experiences word-finding difficulties and struggles to express her thoughts clearly. She reports sometimes losing track during conversations and having difficulty following complex instructions.\n\n\n\nEmotional Symptoms:\n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis reports experiencing significant emotional changes since the accident that have profoundly impacted her daily life and relationships. She describes persistent anxiety, particularly related to vehicles and transportation. When being driven by others, she often closes her eyes and becomes hypervigilant about potential accident scenarios. She has not attempted to drive since the accident and becomes notably distressed when passing near the accident location. This vehicle-related anxiety has led to significant avoidance behaviors - she rarely leaves her house except for medical appointments, which has contributed to increasing social isolation.\n\n\n\nHer mood has deteriorated significantly since the accident. While she had a pre-existing history of depression that was well-managed before the collision, she reports her symptoms have intensified considerably. She experiences frequent tearfulness, particularly when discussing the impact of the accident on her life and work abilities. She describes a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities and has withdrawn from most social interactions. Ms. Slykhuis reports spending most of her time at home alone, having difficulty initiating even basic activities like watching television or responding to phone messages from friends.\n\n\n\nOf particular concern are her post-traumatic stress symptoms. She experiences frequent nightmares about the accident that disrupt her sleep. These nightmares often cause her to wake in a state of panic, after which she has difficulty returning to sleep. She reports intrusive thoughts about the accident throughout the day and finds herself reliving aspects of the event. This has led to what she describes as persistent anxiety about bedtime, knowing these disturbing dreams are likely to occur.\n\n\n\nThe impact on her social relationships has been substantial. While she maintains phone contact with her sons, she notes they are busy with their own lives. She expresses particular distress about her reduced ability to fulfill her previous parenting role, especially regarding her 17-year-old son who recently moved away for post-secondary education. While she has a supportive circle of friends who offer assistance, she acknowledges a tendency to isolate herself and not respond to their attempts to connect.\n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis expresses significant concern about her future, particularly regarding her ability to return to work. She worries about how her extended absence will be perceived by colleagues and fears she may never regain her previous level of function. She describes feeling \"trapped\" in her current situation, wanting to improve but feeling overwhelmed by her physical symptoms and emotional responses.\n\n\n\nSymptom Management Strategies:\n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis reports attempting to manage her symptoms through:\n\nRegular rest periods throughout the day\n\nUse of prescribed medications for pain and mood\n\nPrescribed sleeping medications\n\nLimited walking with her dog when able\n\nSupport from personal support worker for daily activities\n\nAvoiding anxiety-provoking situations\n\nUse of positioning and supports for physical comfort\n\nWriting notes to compensate for memory difficulties\n\n\n\n\n\nFUNCTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL OBSERVATIONS:\n\n\n\nDuring the assessment, Ms. Slykhuis presented as a well-groomed woman who appeared her stated age. She was oriented to person, place, and time, though she demonstrated some difficulty recalling specific dates and details of recent events. She engaged appropriately in the assessment process but required frequent breaks due to pain and fatigue. Her affect was generally flat, with periods of tearfulness when discussing the impact of the accident on her life. Her speech was clear but showed occasional word-finding difficulties and slowed processing speed.\n\n\n\n\n\nTolerances, Mobility and Transfers: \n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis demonstrated significant limitations in her physical functioning during the assessment. When sitting, she could tolerate approximately 20-25 minutes before needing to change positions due to increasing pain. She was observed frequently shifting between positions and supporting her left chest area with her arm or a pillow. Even during these brief sitting periods, she displayed visible signs of discomfort including grimacing and guarding behaviors.\n\n\n\nBed mobility was observed to be significantly compromised. Ms. Slykhuis required multiple steps to transition from lying to sitting, frequently pausing due to pain. She demonstrated a consistent need to support her chest area during these movements and showed increased difficulty with movements to her left side.\n\n\n\nTransfers were completed independently but with notable difficulty. When moving from sitting to standing, Ms. Slykhuis was observed to brace herself using nearby furniture and demonstrated a multi-step process that included pausing mid-transfer to manage pain. She required standby assistance during bathroom transfers and showed increased difficulty with lower surface heights such as the toilet. While she maintained independence with shower transfers, she demonstrated significant guarding behaviors and relied heavily on grab bars for support.\n\n\n\nWalking was observed to be slow and deliberate, with Ms. Slykhuis adopting a guarded posture that favored her left side. She used a single-point cane for stability during ambulation and was observed to reach for walls or furniture when walking without the cane. Her walking endurance was limited to approximately 200 meters, after which she reported significant increases in pain and required rest. Her gait pattern showed evidence of compensation, with reduced arm swing on the left side and shortened step length.\n\n\n\nBalance testing revealed impairments in both static and dynamic balance. Ms. Slykhuis demonstrated increased sway during quiet standing and required upper extremity support during any reaching or bending activities. She was unable to perform tandem stance or single-leg stance due to instability and fear of falling. These balance impairments significantly impact her safety with daily activities and increase her risk for falls.\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Range of Motion:\n\n\n\nRange of motion testing revealed significant limitations, particularly in the trunk and upper body. Ms. Slykhuis demonstrated reduced cervical range of motion in all planes, with pain limiting end-range movements. Shoulder range of motion was notably restricted on the left side, with pain reported throughout the available range. Trunk mobility was severely limited, with Ms. Slykhuis unable to bend forward beyond approximately 30 degrees due to pain. She demonstrated compensatory movements when reaching or bending, often shifting her entire body rather than moving through her trunk. \n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional Presentation:\n\n\n\nMs. Slykhuis's emotional presentation during the assessment was characterized by frequent shifts in affect. While she attempted to engage appropriately in the assessment process, she became tearful when discussing the impact of her injuries on her independence and ability to work. She appeared anxious when discussing transportation needs and future medical appointments. Her mood appeared to deteriorate as the assessment progressed and her pain and fatigue increased.\n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive Presentation:\n\n\n\nDuring the assessment, Ms. Slykhuis demonstrated several cognitive challenges that impacted her engagement. Her processing speed was notably slowed, requiring additional time to comprehend questions and formulate responses. She frequently lost her train of thought during the interview and required prompting to return to the original topic. Her responses were often tangential, requiring gentle redirection to maintain focus on the assessment components.\n\nMemory difficulties were evident throughout the assessment. Ms. Slykhuis needed to refer to written notes for appointment dates and medication details. She demonstrated difficulty recalling recent events in sequence and showed inconsistency in her recall of medical appointments.\n\n\n\nTYPICAL DAY:\n\n\n\nBased on Ms. Slykhuis's report during the assessment, her current daily routine consists of the following:\n\n\n\nMorning Routine: She typically wakes between 7:00-8:30 AM, often after a disrupted night's sleep due to pain and nightmares. She takes her dog for a brief morning walk, though she reports this is challenging due to pain and requires frequent stops. After returning home, she reports needing to lie down to recover from this activity.\n\n\n\nShe will make a simple breakfast shake or coffee and move to her living room sofa. She attempts to check emails but reports this is often challenging due to concentration difficulties and physical discomfort when sitting at her computer. She requires frequent position changes and often needs to lie down after 20-30 minutes of sitting upright.\n\n\n\nAfternoon Activities: Around noon, she takes her dog out again, typically sitting outside while throwing a frisbee rather than walking due to increased pain and fatigue. She relies on reheating prepared foods for lunch as she reports difficulty with meal preparation tasks.\n\n\n\nShe typically needs to rest in bed around 1:00 PM, describing this as the time when her symptoms are most severe (\"c'est la que ca frappe\"). After resting, she attempts some light housekeeping tasks such as loading/unloading the dishwasher or light tidying, but reports these activities often increase her pain significantly.\n\n\n\nEvening Routine: Ms. Slykhuis reports having difficulty with meal preparation and often relies on takeout or reheated meals. She attempts another short walk with her dog in the evening, typically combining this with seated frisbee play to manage her symptoms.\n\n\n\nShe reports going to bed around 7:00 PM, though she has difficulty falling asleep due to pain and anxiety. She listens to podcasts but reports being unable to follow the content. She takes her evening medications and attempts to sleep around 8:30-9:00 PM. She reports waking 3-4 times per night due to pain and nightmares, requiring repositioning and occasionally getting up for water. She notes feeling unsteady during these nighttime awakenings.\n\n\n\nSocial/Leisure Activities: Ms. Slykhuis reports that her social and leisure activities have been significantly curtailed since the accident. While she previously enjoyed frequent social outings and travel to the United States, she now rarely leaves her home except for medical appointments. Her primary social interaction is through phone conversations with family members and occasional visits from friends who assist with errands or grocery shopping.\n\n\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT:\n\n\n\nTYPE OF DWELLING\n\nBungalow \n\nROOMS\n\nQty\n\nLOCATION/DESCRIPTION\n\nFLOOR COVERING\n\nBedrooms\n\n3\n\nMain level\n\nHardwood\n\nBathrooms\n\n2\n\nMain bathroom: Tub/shower combination with bath chair, removable showerhead (broken), raised toilet seat\n\nTile\n\nLiving Room\n\n1\n\nMain floor, open concept with kitchen\n\nHardwood\n\nKitchen\n\n1\n\nConnected to living room, standard height counters\n\nTile\n\nLaundry\n\n1\n\nLocated in main bathroom\n\nTile\n\nStairs\n\nYes\n\nTwo steps to front entrance without handrail \n\nTwo steps to back deck without handrail \n\nFour steps from deck to yard with unilateral handrail\n\nConcrete\n\nBasement\n\nYes\n\nRented to roommate, not accessed during assessment\n\nN/A\n\nDriveway Description\n\n\n\nPaved driveway present\n\n\n\nYard description\n\n\n\nFlat yard with grass\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLIVING ARRANGEMENTS/SOCIAL STATUS:\n\n\n\nMarital Status: Single\n\n\n\nLiving Arrangement: Ms. Slykhuis lives alone in her bungalow. Her 17-year-old son recently moved out to pursue post-secondary education. She has a roommate who rents the basement but they function independently.\n\n\n\n\n\nChildren: Five children (two daughters and three sons) ranging in age from 19-34 years old. She maintains contact with her sons but reports limited contact with her daughters. Her youngest son recently moved out to attend post-secondary education.\n\n\n\n\n\nLIVING ARRANGEMENTS/SOCIAL STATUS:\n\n\n\nMarital Status\n\nMarried           ☐ \n\nSingle               X \n\nCommon Law  ☐ \n\nOther               ☐\n\nLiving Arrangement\n\nLives alone\n\nChildren\n\n5 children born 1992 - 2005\n\n\n\n\n\nACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (Pre and Post Accident):\n\n\n\nPre and Post Accident Self-Care Activities:\n\n\n\nShowers have become an infrequent activity for her, a stark contrast to the regular routine she once maintained. The loss of her daily Personal Support Worker (PSW) disrupted the flow she was accustomed to, making it difficult to find a suitable replacement. Washing her hair was an ordeal she could only manage with the assistance of her PSW, as standing in the shower often left her feeling extremely dizzy. To alleviate this, her PSW would keep the shower door open, providing a sense of security and immediate aid if needed.\n\n\n\nWhen showering without assistance, she would do so sitting down to prevent falls. Sometimes, she would remain in the same clothing for three to four days, and it was not unusual for her to keep her daytime bra on for extended periods.\n\n\n\nIndoor tasks, such as meal preparation and dishwashing, which she previously managed independently, now present new challenges.\n\n\n\n\n\nHome Management Activities:\n\n\n\nLegend of Ability:\n\nI – Independent    A – Partial with assistance     D – With devices    U – Unable    NA – Not Applicable\n\n\n\n\n\nIndoor Tasks\n\nPre-accident Engagement\n\nCurrent Engagement\n\nMeal Preparation\n\nI - Independent with all meal preparation including cooking full meals.
