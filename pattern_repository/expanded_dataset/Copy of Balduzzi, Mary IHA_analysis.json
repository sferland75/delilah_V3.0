He provides assessment and treatment services as a primary Occupational Therapist as well as a Case Manager for individuals who sustained traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries and amputations.  He also has extensive experience working with individuals who have been deemed to meet the catastrophic threshold on the basis of psychological and/or psychiatric impairments.\n\n\n\nOver his years of working with individuals injured in motor vehicle accidents, Sebastien developed a strong interest in the field of mental health, focussed on functional reactivation for injured individuals suffering from depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress.  His clinical acumen has led him to be qualified as an Expert in his field by the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.  \n\n\n\n\n\nPURPOSE OF REFERRAL:\n\n\n\nTo perform an assessment with respect to Ms. Balduzzi’s ability to manage those functional activities Ms. Balduzzi was responsible for prior to the motor vehicle accident of 2017-02-14.\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi is an 85-year-old woman who was involved in a car vs. pedestrian collision while she was walking from her car to a Tim Horton’s restaurant on February 14, 2017.  As a result of the subject motor vehicle accident, Ms. Balduzzi sustained the following injuries:\n\n\n\nFractured left ankle (ORIF, 13 screws and a plate)\n\nLaceration below the left knee\n\nSubsequent MRSA infection in the leg\n\n\n\nFollowing her accident, Ms. Balduzzi was hospitalized for a period of over 5 months, finally being discharged home from Elizabeth Bruyère hospital on July 20, 2017.  She underwent a course of physiotherapy and obtained some support from an occupational therapist.  Overall, her medical condition has been monitored by her family physician with limited additional resources.  \n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi’s past medical history is positive for the following conditions:\n\n\n\nComplete reversed shoulder replacement in 2010, left-sided, as a result of a slip and fall where she shattered her shoulder.\n\nHypothyroidism\n\nSleep apnea\n\nThallasemia trait\n\nOsteoporosis\n\n\n\nAs a result of her shoulder-related impairments, Ms. Balduzzi reported that she obtained assistance with showering and hair care once weekly from a Personal Support Worker provided through the CCAC.  She noted that she was required to increase the frequency of her PSW support to twice weekly post-accident.\n\n\n\nFrom a symptom perspective, Ms. Balduzzi is reporting ongoing pain in her left  lower leg  and lower back.  These symptoms coupled with the significant degree of deconditioning which has taken place have resulted in a complete interruption in her ability to engage in her daily activities.\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi proudly expressed how well she functioned pre-accident and her daughter Linda echoed this sentiment.  Ms. Balduzzi noted that she only relied on assistance once per week from a PSW pre-accident due to limitations to her left.  Ms. Balduzzi explained that she was able to manage all of self-care functions independently with the exception of bathing and shampooing her hair.  She reported that she was “out and about all of the time”.  She rarely ate at home, choosing to eat-out many meals which afforded a degree of distraction and quality of life.  She drove herself from one community location to another throughout the day and was self-reliant in all of her self-care needs.\n\n\n\nAt the time of this assessment, Ms. Balduzzi explained that she has been “a prisoner in my home” for over two years.  Her significant mobility restrictions resulting from her accident-related injuries has had a profound impact on her ability to care for herself leading to a sharp deterioration in her quality of life.  Ms. Balduzzi’s mobility has been affected to such a degree that she cannot (safely or without assistance) manage the front steps leading out of her home.  She has now wears nightgowns at all times of the day eliminating the need to change her clothes regularly and she requires assistance to don outdoor footwear.  She noted that she was required to purchase new wardrobe items to replace the ones she cannot don or doff independently.  She no longer leaves her home to access restaurants to eat her meals and as a result, relies on frozen dinners or dinners cooked by her daughter Linda to meet her dietary needs.  She will at times supplement these meals with some steamed vegetables but is unable to cook a meal from scratch independently. \n\n\n\nAs a result of her 2010 shoulder injury and subsequent surgery, Ms. Balduzzi relied on some assistance for the heavier and more physical aspects of maintaining her home.  She reported that her neighbour would assist with cutting her lawn while she hired a snow removal contractor in the winter to maintain her driveway and provide access to her car garage.  She reported that her daughter assisted her with heavier indoor housekeeping tasks such as vacuuming and mopping while her PSW cleaned the bathtub weekly.  Ms. Balduzzi remained independent with the management of sweeping, laundry, garbage removal and dusting.  At this time, Ms. Balduzzi has completely interrupted her involvement in any form of housekeeping or home maintenance activities.  \n\n\n\nPrior to the subject motor vehicle accident, Ms. Balduzzi noted that she was highly active in the community and engaged in the following leisure activities:\n\n\n\nAttended church weekly\n\nWent to the Casino\n\nDined out 4 – 5x per week\n\nWent shopping at local malls/stores\n\nAttended family gatherings\n\nSpent time with her grandchildren\n\nTravelled abroad (went to Hong Kong and Hawaii)\n\n\n\nAt this juncture, Ms. Balduzzi has completely interrupted her pre-accident pace of life.  She no longer goes to church and no longer attends the Casino.  She will go out for dinner only when family members invite her out and she no longer enjoys shopping.  She reports limited time spent with her grandchildren largely as a result of her limited ability to get out of her home.  She has not travelled since the accident.\n\n\n\nSince the last Assessment of Attendant Care Needs performed on July 20, 2018, there has been no substantive change in the level of care required by Ms. Balduzzi with the exception of an assessed need for 24-hour care as opposed to 8-hour care previously assessed due to her inability to exit her home in case of an emergency at all times.  In this therapist’s opinion, Ms. Balduzzi’s level of deconditioning due to her limited activity levels has resulted in a deterioration of her mobility.  She is not, in this therapist’s opinion, able to exit her home in case of an emergency at any time of day.  While previously found to be self-sufficient during waking hours, this therapist believes that she is now completely dependent on care to safely exit her home in case of an emergency such as a fire.  All other aspects of care remain the same.  \n\n\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n\n\nAttendant Care:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi is found to have deteriorated with respect to her ability to be self-sufficient in case of an emergency.  She is thus found to require 24-hour care on this basis resulting in a significant increase in her Attendant Care Needs monthly assessed benefit.  She currently is assessed as requiring 24-hour care translating to a monthly benefit of $10193.63.\n\n\n\n\n\nHousekeeping:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi currently requires approximately 2 hours per week of housekeeping assistance to help manage those housekeeping and home maintenance tasks she was responsible for prior to her accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nAssistive Devices:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi’s needs for assistive devices to further her functional recovery will be addressed through the delivery of Occupational Therapy treatment proposed below.  There were no devices currently indicated on an urgent basis to mitigate and risks to her safety.\n\n\n\n\n\nFurther Occupational Therapy Interventions:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi would benefit from the provision of Occupational Therapy treatment to address her home safety issues and specifically her accessibility to and from her home.  She is currently unable to safely manage the front stairs of her home and this has resulted in her remaining in her home for the larger part of the last 2 years.  Further interventions focussed on improving her quality of life will be address as appropriate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferral for Other Services:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi would benefit from the involvement of a contractor to assist with developing a solution to her home entry and egress issues.  A referral will be forwarded to Mr. Scott Puddicombe of Puddicombe Home Access to initiate work on this front.\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi would benefit from a resumption of Physiotherapy treatments and to that end, a referral has been forwarded to her physiotherapist Trina Ferrer who now works through the offices of Swanson & Associates.\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT:\n\n\n\nThis therapist has reviewed issues related to consent as per the requirements outlined by the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario:\n\n\n\nAn occupational therapy assessment is to be conducted by this therapist, a registered occupational therapist with the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario (COTO).\n\nThe assessment has been requested by her legal representative, Mr. Paul Auerbach.\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to assess Ms. Balduzzi’s current functional status as it relates to the ability to complete the reported pre-accident activities of daily living.\n\nThe proposed assessment will include: an interview, a physical assessment and also observations of the ability to complete functional tasks within and around the home as well as education on safe means of completing activities of daily living if required.\n\nDue to the physical nature of the assessment, pain and fatigue are possible temporary side effects.\n\nRecommendations may be provided at the conclusion of the assessment.  These recommendations may include:\n\nOccupational Therapy Treatment\n\nAssistive Devices\n\nReferral to other practitioners\n\nSupport services\n\nA submission for funding will be submitted to the insurer for any goods and/or services on an OCF18 – Assessment and Treatment Plan.  The insurer may approve or deny the plan (in part or in whole).  Should a denial or partial denial occur, an independent examination by another Occupational Therapist may be requested by the insurer.  This may be an in-person assessment or a remote paper-review assessment.  Funding for the requested goods and/or services may ultimately be declined.\n\nMs. Balduzzi may choose to participate or decline any or all of the proposed assessment.\n\nA report documenting this assessment will be completed and copies will be provided to the following parties via secure transmission (fax or encrypted email attachment):\n\nMcNally Gervan c/o Paul Auerbach\n\nTravelers Insurance\n\n\n\nFollowing this therapist’s explanation Ms. Balduzzi granted informed consent for this therapist to proceed with the assessment and any subsequent interventions. \n\n\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:\n\n\n\nA complete list of documentation reviewed is available upon request.\n\n\n\n\n\nPRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\n\n\nMs Balduzzi is an 85 year-old female who resides alone ina single family home in Ottawa, Ontario.  She provided the following pre-existing medical history:\n\n\n\nComplete reversed shoulder replacement in 2010, left-sided, as a result of a slip and fall where she shattered her shoulder.\n\nHypothyroidism\n\nSleep apnea\n\nThallasemia trait\n\nOsteoporosis\n\n\n\nAs a result of her shoulde-related impairments, Ms. Balduzzi reported that she obtained assistance with showering and hair care once weekly from a Personal Support Worker provided through the CCAC.  She noted that she was required to increase the frequency of her PSW support to twice weekly post-accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nMECHANISM OF INJURY:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi repored that she drove her vehicle to a local Tim Horton’s to purchase a Valentine’s Day donut on the date of loss.  She parked her vehicle and began walking to the coffee shop when a vehicle travelling through the parkin lot struck her on the left side of her body, throwing her to the ground.  She indicated that her left leg slid under the vehicle but that the vehicle never drove over her lefg.  Paramedics attended the scene of the accident and took Ms. Balduzzi to the Ottawa Hospital – Civic Campus trauma unit where she was assessed and hospitalized for 3 weeks before being transferred to other facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nNATURE OF INJURY:\n\n\n\nAs a result of the subject motor vehicle accident, Ms. Balduzzi sustained the following injuries:\n\n\n\nFractured left ankle (ORIF, 13 screws and a plate)\n\nLaceration below the left knee\n\nSubsequent MRSA infection in the leg\n\n\n\nOn March 7, 2017, Ms. Balduzzi reported that she was transferred to the Perly Hospital and was subsequently transferred to the Elizabeth Brueyere Hospital where she convalesced and underwent rehabilitation until July 20, 2017 when she was discharged home.\n\n\n\n\n\nCOURSE OF RECOVERY TO DATE:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi reportred that following discharge, she was provided with Occupational Therapy treatments through FunctionAbility, a private provider of OT services funded through her auto insurer.\n\nShe reported undergoing physiotherapy treatments through Apollo Physical Therapy Centres but noted that she has not received treatment since October or November of 2018.  \n\nShe benefitted from nursing care through the CCAC to dress the wound on her left leg.\n\n\n\n\n\nCURRENT MEDICAL/REHABILITATION TEAM:\n\n\n\nHealth Professional Name and Specialty\n\nDate of Last Appointment/ Frequency of appointments\n\nOutcome of Last Appointment\n\nDate of Next Appointment\n\nDr. Tettrault, GP\n\nNovember 2018\n\nPrescription renewal\n\nTBD, as needed\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi has requested a change of Occupational Therapy provider leading to this current assessment.  This therapist will be managing Ms. Balduzzi’s Occupational Therapy needs moving forward.\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi requires ongoing access to Physiotherapy and as such, a referral has been forwarded to her Physiotherapist Ms. Trina Ferrer who is now working through Swanson & Associates where her care will continue to be provided.\n\n\n\n\n\nMEDICATION:\n\n\n\nMedication Name\n\nDosage/Frequency\n\nPurpose\n\nSynthroid\n\n0.125 mg/day\n\nHypothyroidism\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSUBJECTIVE INFORMATION (CLIENT REPORT):\n\n\n\nPhysical Symptoms:\n\n\n\nPain symptoms are rated on an analog pain scale where 0 = no pain and 10 = intolerable pain.\n\nSymptom/Complaint\n\nDetails\n\nPain Rating if Necessary\n\nLeft lower leg\n\nBurning pain in the left lower-leg.\n\nFeels like the inside of her leg is “frozen”, decreased sensation\n\nIntermittent sharp pain\n\n2 – 5/10\n\nBack pain\n\nLower back pain which does not radiate to her buttocks or lower extremities.\n\n6/10\n\nRight knee\n\nHas to be careful how she positions the left knee as she feels it can flare.  Stiffness ans some degree of pain.\n\nNA\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi reported a fall from a chair in November of 2017 while engaged in home-based physio exercises.  She struck her head and reports ongoing headaches which she was not prone to pre-accident.  She reports some ongoing pressure in the right side of her skull.  She reports memory issues on occasion.\n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive Symptoms:\n\n\n\nWhen questioned about changes to her cognitive status, Ms. Balduzzi noted that she does continue to experience some memory issues and word finding issues which were not present pre-accident.  She is unsure if this is related to the subject accident or to the fall experienced during physiotherapy treatments detailed above.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional Symptoms:\n\n\n\nWhen questioned about her emotional state, Ms. Balduzzi provided the following account of her status:\n\n\n\nDepressed from lack of independence, wants to drive desperately\n\nFeels like she is living in a prison, stuck in the home for over 2 years\n\nUsed to do all her own housework, now relies on assistance from her daughter Linda to manage her household.\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi’s primary area of frustration was reported to be related to the lack of accessibility in her home which has yet to be addressed to her satisfaction.  She noted that some work was done to improve the front door accessibility to her home (paving stones levelled; small gravel “ramp” built) however these changes have done little to allow her to be more independent.  She is seeking assistance to have the front entrance accessibility issues of her home addressed to allow her to independently leave her home and begin work on resuming driving and community outings.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptom Management Strategies:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi noted that she has little in the way of symptom management strategies other than resting and activity avoidance.  Unfortunately, this has resulted in a significant level of deconditioning for this client and will lead to further rehabilitative requirements in her functional recovery.\n\n\n\n\n\nTypical Day Post-Accident:\n\n\n\nUp at 8 am\n\nTakes medication\n\nRead newspaper, has coffee, has toast\n\nDoes exercises\n\nWill make a sandwish, elevates her leg for an hour\n\nWill wash some dishes\n\nMakes some phone calls\n\nWill wash some more dishes\n\nElevates her leg again\n\nWill prepare dinner (steam a vegetable and cooks frozen meals, Red Apron meals, her daughter Linda also prepares a meal 1 – 2x/week)\n\nWill watch News, Coronation Street, sometimes a movie\n\nWill spend time on the computer\n\nWill lie down around 9pm but does not fall asleep right away\n\n\n\n\n\nOBJECTIVE INFORMATION:\n\n\n\n\n\nPostural Tolerances:\n\n\n\nActivity\n\nClient Self-Report\n\nPre-Accident\n\nClient Self-Report\n\nPost-Accident\n\nTherapist Observation\n\n1.

Ms. Balduzzi expressed a great degree of anger and frustration at her situation and this frustration permeated much of the dialogue held over this 2-session assessment.  Ms. Balduzzi’s frustration with various individuals who attempted to support her in the past was freely expressed on several occasions.  Ms. Balduzzi required a certain degree of refocusing throughout this assessment to move the conversation along.  Her daughter Linda was observed intervening on several occasions to support her mother and assist her in “moving on” with the current assessment.  There were no signs of emotional lability nted during this assessment.  \n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive Presentation:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi’s cognitive presentation was unremarkable during this assessment.  She was alert to all spheres and engaged this therapist in discussion without difficulty.  She was able to remember names and dates relating to past events and expressed her needs in a very clear albeit tangential manner.  Her daughter Linda confirmed that her mother’s cognitive state has not been an area of significant concern.\n\n\n\n\n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT:\n\n\n\n\n\nTYPE OF DWELLING\n\n\n\nROOMS\n\nQty\n\nLOCATION/DESCRIPTION\n\nFLOOR COVERING\n\nBedrooms\n\n3\n\n \n\n \n\nBathrooms\n\n1\n\nMain floor\n\nLinolium\n\nLiving Room\n\n1\n\n \n\n \n\nFamily Room\n\n1\n\n \n\n \n\nDining Room\n\n1\n\n \n\n \n\nKitchen \n\n1\n\n \n\nLinolium\n\nLaundry\n\n1\n\nBasement\n\n \n\nStairs\n\n\n\nSteps leading to the basement of the home.\n\n\n\nBasement\n\n\n\n\n\nNA\n\nDriveway Description\n\nLong multi0car laneway leading to exterior garage structure separate from the home where Ms. Balduzzi parks her vehicle.\n\nYard description\n\nLarge city lot\n\n\n\n\n\nLIVING ARRANGEMENTS/SOCIAL STATUS:\n\n\n\nMarital Status\n\nMarried  Single   Common Law   Other  \n\nLiving Arrangement\n\nLives alone with 2x per week PSW support and regular support from her daughter Linda.\n\nChildren\n\nNone living in the home\n\n\n\n\n\nACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (Pre and Post Accident):\n\n\n\nPre and Post Accident Self-Care Activities:\n\n\n\nMs. Balduzzi proudly expressed how well she functioned pre-accident and her daughter Linda echoed this sentiment.  Ms. Balduzzi noted that she only relied on assistance once per week from a PSW once weekly pre-accident due to limitations to her left shoulder which he had injured pre-accident.  Ms. Balduzzi explained that she was able to manage all of self-care functions independently with the exception of bathing and shampooing her hair.  She reported that she was “out and about all of the time”.  She rarely ate at home, choosing to eat-out many meals which afforded a degree of distraction and quality of life.

She has now wears nightgowns at all time of the day eliminating the need to change her clothes regularly and requires assistance to don outdoor footwear.  She noted that she was required to purchase new wardrobe items to replace the ones she cannot don or doff independently.  She no longer leaves her home to access restaurants to eat her meals and as a result, relies on frozen dinners or dinners cooked by her daughter Linda to meet her dietary needs.  She will at times supplement these meals with some steamed vegetables but is unable to cook a meal from scratch independently. \n\n\n\nPlease refer to the Attendant Care section of this report for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre and Post Accident Home Management Activities:\n\n\n\nAs a result of her 2010 shoulder injury and subsequent surgery, Ms. Balduzzi relied on some assistance for the heavier and more physical aspects of maintaining her home.  She reported that her neighbour would assist with cutting her lawn while she hired a snow removal contractor in the winter to maintain her driveway and provide access to her car garage.  She reported that her daughter assisted her with heavier indoor housekeeping tasks such as vacuuming and mopping while her PSW cleaned the bathtub weekly.  Ms. Balduzzi remained independent with the management of sweeping, laundry, garbage removal and dusting.\n\n\n\nAt this time, Ms. Balduzzi has completely interrupted her involvement in any form of housekeeping or home maintenance activities.  She is now in need of/receiving the following assistance:\n\n\n\nSweeping 35 minutes per week\n\nLaundry 60 minutes per week\n\nGarbage removal 15 minutes per week\n\nDusting 20 minutes per week\n\n\n\nA total amount of 2 hours per week of assistance would be indicated to replace the housekeeping services Ms. Balduzzi reported performing pre-accident.\n\n\n\n\n\nPre and Post Accident Leisure Activities:\n\n\n\nPrior to the subject motor vehicle accident, Ms. Balduzzi noted that she was highly active in the community and engaged in the following leisure activities:\n\n\n\nAttended church weekly\n\nWent to the Casino\n\nDined out 4 – 5x per week\n\nWent shopping at local malls/stores\n\nAttended family gatherings\n\nSpent time with her grandchildren\n\nTravelled abroad (went to Hong Kong and Hawaii)\n\n\n\nAt this juncture, Ms. Balduzzi has completely interrupted her pre-accident pace of life.  She no longer goes to church and no longer attends the Casino.  She will go out for dinner only when family members invite her out and she no longer enjoys shopping.  She reports limited time spent with her grandchildren largely as a result of her limited ability to get out of her home.  She has not travelled since the accident.  She and her daughter Linda held an exchange over family plans to take Ms. Balduzzi to Rome for a vacation in the summer of 2019 where Ms. Balduzzi became combative and indicated she did not wish to go.\n\n\n\n\n\nASSESSMENT OF ATTENDANT CARE NEEDS:\n\n\n\nSince the last Assessment of Attendant Care Needs performed on July 20, 2018, there has been no substantive change in the level of care required by Ms. Balduzzi with the exception of an assessed need for 24-hour care as opposed to 8-hour care previously assessed due to her inability to exit her home in case of an emergency at all times.  In this therapist’s opinion, Ms. Balduzzi’s level of deconditioning due to her limited activity levels has resulted in a deterioration of her mobility.  She is not, in this therapist’s opinion, able to exit her home in case of an emergency at any time of day.
