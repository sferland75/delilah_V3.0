The referral was for the introduction of  Occupational Therapy services to assist Ms. Pasqua in addressing the significant deterioration in  function as a result of psychological struggles subsequent to her husband’s involvement in two  motor vehicle accidents in 2016 and 2017. An OCF18 was submitted for this assessment  following a screening assessment with Ms. Pasqua and a conversation with her insurance  adjuster Mr. Ian Christie. The OCF18 was approved in full for the completion of this In-Home  Assessment. \n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS: \n\nMs. Pasqua is a 31 year-old mother of two young children whose husband was involved in two  motor vehicle accidents on August 8, 2016 and May 19, 2017. Following these two motor  vehicle accidents, Ms. Pasqua describes changes in her husband’s personality and behaviours  which have a significant impact on her own mental health. She describes issues with verbal  aggression and a general sense of detachment within the couple which has led her to experience  severe symptoms of depression and anxiety. \n\nPrior to the subject motor vehicle accidents, Ms. Pasqua describes herself as functioning well in  all aspects of her life. She was engaged in managing the family home, preparing meals for her  family, and caring for her child (the second being born after the subject MVAs). She reports a  healthy relationship with her husband and a number of close friendships. She was physically  active and reported no significant pre-existing medical issues. She notes having been diagnosed  with a learning disability as a child, having only begun speaking at age 3. She went on to  complete most of her high school credits and reports having completed an aesthetician  certificate. \n\nAt the time of this assessment, Ms. Pasqua presented with a high degree of functional  deactivation. She rarely leaves the home and noted severe anxiety when outside her home. She  avoids eye contact when out in public and experiences severe anxiety when riding as a passenger  in a vehicle. She now rarely drives and when she does it is only for short distances, with severe  levels of anxiety. She noted that she fears having a panic attack while behind the wheel. Ms.  Pasqua and this therapist took a short walk to the mailbox located 200 meters from her home  which produced a severe anxiety response requiring this therapist to intervene with a guided  breathing exercise. While at home, Ms. Pasqua noted that she does little in the way of  contributing to the management of the home. She rarely cleans, noting that she spends her days  “on autopilot”. She will spend most of the day sitting on the couch “zoned-out” in front of the  television watching children’s shows while her two children play in the living room. She rarely  prepares meals for her family and reported a sense of immense guilt at her inability to do more for her family. Ms. Pasqua noted a significant decreased in her overall self-care including  decreased grooming and infrequent showering. She has been avoiding contact with close friends  and has become highly socially isolated. She noted that her friends have become upset at her  lack of responsiveness to texts and emails.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________ Christina Pasqua Claim #: 5030704357 Page 2 of 14 \n\nDate of Report: 2021-03-31 \n\nMs. Pasqua would greatly benefit from the introduction of Occupational Therapy to deliver a  comprehensive Functional Reactivation Program. She requires professional support of an OT in  tandem with her treating psychologist to effect substantial change to her level of function. The  program will be guided with a progressive structure of functional goals which will be client driven and focussed on assisting Ms. Pasqua in gradually re-integrating aspects of pre-accident  function to her day to day activities. \n\nRECOMMENDATIONS: \n\nAttendant Care: \n\nBased on this assessment, Ms. Pasqua is currently not in need of Attendant Care for the  management of her core daily self-care functions. No Form 1 has been completed at this time. \n\nHousekeeping: \n\nWhile Ms. Pasqua is physically able to engage in housekeeping activities, her mental health has  severely impacted her ability to engage in pre-accident housekeeping tasks as a result of lack of  motivation, low energy levels and severe anxiety. She would at this time benefit from ?? hours  per week of housekeeping assistance to help manage those housekeeping functions she is no  \n\nlonger performing. \n\nAssistive Devices: \n\nThere are no assistive devices currently indicated to further Ms. Pasqua’s functional recovery at  this time. \n\nFurther Occupational Therapy Interventions: \n\nMs. Pasqua would benefit from Occupational Therapy treatment at this time as indicated above.  The proposed service delivery model will be a Functional Reactivation Program aimed at  promoting a gradual return to pre-accident activities and fostering improvements in her overall  mental health symptoms. \n\nReferral for Other Services: \n\nThere are no referrals indicated at this time. \n\n______________________________________________________________________________ Christina Pasqua Claim #: 5030704357 Page 3 of 14 \n\nDate of Report: 2021-03-31 \n\nINFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT: \n\nThis therapist has reviewed issues related to consent as per the requirements outlined by the  College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario: \n\n• An occupational therapy assessment is to be conducted by this therapist, a registered  occupational therapist with the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario (COTO). • The assessment has been requested by her legal representative Frank McNally of McNally  Gervan Law Firm. \n\n• The purpose of this assessment is to assess Ms. Pasqua’s current functional status as it  relates to the ability to complete the reported pre-accident activities of daily living. • The proposed assessment will include: an interview, a physical assessment and also  \n\nobservations of the ability to complete functional tasks within and around the home as well  as education on safe means of completing activities of daily living if required. • Due to the physical nature of the assessment, pain and fatigue are possible temporary side  effects. \n\n• Recommendations may be provided at the conclusion of the assessment.

Gerber dated February 7,  2020 re: OCF-18 of Dr. N. Rossy\n\n• Psychological Assessment Report completed by Dr. K. Payne dated September 11,  2019 \n\n• Psychological Assessment - Addendum Report completed by Dr. K. Payne dated  September 27, 2019 \n\n• Psychological Progress Report dated October 5, 2020 \n\nPRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY: \n\nWas in a bad relationship 10 years ago with reports of physical and emotional abuse. She vaguely  recalls speaking with someone for women’s services following conviction of her ex-partner. She  notes that she took medication for a short period of time and returned to normal life afterwards.  She continued to work throughout this episode. \n\nCOURSE OF EVENTS: \n\nOn August 8, 2016, Ms. Pasqua’s husband had his first motor vehicle accident. At the time, Ms.  Pasqua noted that she worked at Chatters as a sales associate, in the process of being trained to  become a sales manager. She notes that this first accident happened during her training period.  She describes an incident following her husband’s accident where he came into the shop and got  upset with her manager. There was a significant verbal altercation and Ms. Pasqua was  subsequently et go from her position. \n\nShe returned to school following this episode at West-end Academy where she completed a  Medical Aesthetician certificate (where she graduated with honours). She started working in this  field in July of 2017. Her husband had a second MVA during her exams in April or May of that  year. She started a job a few weeks after but only worked for a short period of time (3 months).  She began deteriorating psychologically and eventually found herself unable to drive herself to  work as a result of intense anxiety. She began experiencing anxiety when interacting with the  public and this had a huge impact on her ability to do her job properly. She was let go as a result. \n\nHer friend was a manager at Terra 20 and provided Ms. Pasqua with a job, working in the makeup  and skin care department. She worked there under 4 months and went on maternity leave. Her  husband was reportedly driving her to and from work everyday. She returned to work after her  child turned 1 year of age. \n\nShe started working at Skins Dermacare afterwards performing aesthetician work. This was  around May of 2019. She started driving again at that time with significant difficulty. She was  anxious and arguing with her husband about getting to and from work but she persisted despite  significant anxiety. She experienced profuse sweating, stuttering and severe anxiety. She would  “mess up on files”. She noted this was her dream job and she tried to “push through the anxiety”.  The workplace was only a few minutes away from her home and despite this, she struggled to  drive to work. She and her husband would fight in the morning for 1 – 2 hours over this issue.  She had one episode where she put the car in drive instead of reverse and had a serious panic  attack. She called into work and was told to take some time off. She was let go two weeks later, within the three month probationary period.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________ Christina Pasqua Claim #: 5030704357 Page 5 of 14 \n\nDate of Report: 2021-03-31 \n\nShe started medication but was having severe mood swings. She found out she was pregnant and  stopped medication. She recalls a very difficult pregnancy from an emtotional perspective. She  felt completely defeated. She recalls having a significant emotional distancing from her husband  during that time. “We drifted apart”. \n\nShe notes a significant amount of fighting leading to couple’s therapy with Suzanne Duc,  psychotherapist. She describes a pattern of her husband “exploding” and subsequently “shutting  down” She stays on the couch, does not get dressed in day clothes, does not shower, or brush her  teeth. She does not talk to anyone. She has two close girlfriends who have “known me forever”  but she has not been replying to their texts or attempts for contact. She lost touch with them and  with extended family members. She describes an intense sense of social isolation. \n\nDIAGNOSIS: \n\nBased on a review of available medical documentation, Ms. Pasqua presents with the following  diagnosis: \n\n• Major Depressive Disorder, Single Episode, Moderate, with anxious distress \n\nCURRENT MEDICAL/REHABILITATION TEAM:\n\nHealth  \n\nProfessional  \n\nName and  \n\nSpecialty\n\nDate of Last  \n\nAppointment/ Frequency  of appointments\n\nOutcome of Last  \n\nAppointment\n\nDate of Next  \n\nAppointment\n\nDr. Cherinet Seid,  GP\n\nLast seen one week ago due  to a benign growth in her  throat.

Ms. Pasqua was able to sit through a 2-hour assessment  without requiring a rest or displaying signs of cognitive fatigue. \n\nENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT: \n\nTYPE OF  \n\nDWELLING\n\nTwo-story detached\n\nROOMS \n\nQty \n\nLOCATION/DESCRIPTION \n\nFLOOR COVERING\n\nBedrooms \n\n3 \n\nSecond floor \n\nLaminate\n\nBathrooms \n\n3 \n\nTwo full on second one powder  on main\n\nVinyl and tile\n\nLiving Room \n\n1 \n\nMain floor \n\nLaminate\n\nFamily Room \n\n0 \n\nMain floor \n\nCarpet\n\nDining Room \n\n1 \n\nMain floor \n\nLaminate\n\nKitchen \n\n1 \n\nMain floor \n\nCarpet\n\nLaundry \n\n\n\nMain floor \n\nCarpet\n\nStairs \n\nYes \n\nSteps leading to the second floor  and basement of the home.\n\nCarpet\n\nBasement \n\nYes \n\nFinished with gym \n\nNA\n\nDriveway  \n\nDescription\n\nDouble car\n\nYard  \n\ndescription\n\nYard presents with decking and landscaping throughout with an in-ground  pool.\n\n\n\n\n\nLIVING ARRANGEMENTS/SOCIAL STATUS: \n\nMarital Status \n\nMarried Single Common Law Other \n\nLiving Arrangement \n\nLives with husband and two young children\n\nChildren \n\nTwo children (1 and 3 years-old)\n\n\n\n\n\nACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (Pre and Post Accident): \n\nPre and Post Accident Self-Care Activities: \n\nMs. Pasqua noted that she had no issues managing her self-care prior to the subject motor vehicle  accident. She describes a high level of pride in her appearance, engaging in daily showering and  grooming. She would always dress in day clothes whether she left the home or not.\n\n______________________________________________________________________________ Christina Pasqua Claim #: 5030704357 Page 12 of 14 \n\nDate of Report: 2021-03-31 \n\nAt the time of this assessment, Ms. Pasqua describes a significant decrease in the quality and  frequency of her grooming tasks. She will often not shower for several days, forget to brush her  teeth, stay in her pajamas for the entire day and generally not spend much time on her self-care  functions. She is physically able to manage her self-care however is precluded to do so as a result  of her significant psychological struggles.  \n\nPre and Post Accident Home Management Activities: \n\nPrior to the subject motor vehicle accident, Ms. Pasqua describes a traditional division of tasks  with her husband where he would manage the outdoors of the home and home maintenance/repairs and she would manage the indoor upkeep of the home and prepare meals for the family. She was  the primary caregiver for her child prior to delivering her second child in 2020.  \n\nAt the time of this assessment, Ms. Pasqua noted that she has not been engaged in any form of  regular upkeep of her home. She will clean at a decreased frequency when “things get really bad  or if someone is coming”. She noted having cleaned the home prior to this therapist’s arrival.  Upon touring the home, this therapist noted that the main living area had been cleaned however  the rest of the home was in a state of clutter and generally unkept. Ms. Pasqua shared a high level  of guilt over her lack of engagement in housekeeping tasks. \n\nAt this juncture, Ms. Pasqua would greatly benefit from an estimated 6 hours per week of  housekeeping assistance to provide a once-over deep clean of her home. This need is based on the  size of the home, the presence of two young children as well as a medium-sized dog.  \n\nPre and Post Accident Caregiving Activities: \n\nMs. Pasqua noted that she is the primary caregiver for her two young children and would, have the  accidents not occurred, have continued to manage the primary care for both children.  \n\nAt the time of this assessment, Ms. Pasqua noted that she continues to provide for the core needs  of both her children with support from her husband who is off work on disability at the time of this  assessment. She does describe a decreased level of engagement in play with her children, utilizing  television shows as a primary source of distraction and entertainment for her children. She does  not take them out for walks, does not go to the park due to fears of “having to talk to someone”.  Her husband will assist with bath time and the couple will share bedtime routines by “dividing and  conquering”.  \n\nPre and Post Accident Leisure Activities: \n\nPrior to the subject motor vehicle accident, Ms. Pasqua noted that she participated in the following  leisure activities: \n\n• Gym two to three times weekly \n\n• Shopping\n\n______________________________________________________________________________ Christina Pasqua Claim #: 5030704357 Page 13 of 14 \n\nDate of Report: 2021-03-31 \n\n• Hanging-out with friends \n\n• Walking her dog \n\nAt the time of this assessment, Ms. Pasqua noted that she has not resumed engagement in any of  the leisure activities noted above. She has isolated herself in her home, no longer going to the gym  or going for walks as a result of severe anxiety. She has grown distant from her friends, ignoring  their attempts to reach-out to her. She noted having no meaningful activity which she participates  in on a regular basis. \n\nCONTACT: \n\nThis therapist may be contacted through the offices of FERLAND & ASSOCIATES  REHABILITATION INC. at 613-204-1549 or by email at ferland@ferlandassociates.com . \n\nSincerely, \n\n_______________________ \n\nSebastien Ferland OT Reg.(Ont) \n\nEnclosed: NA \n\nAn electronic signature was used in order to assist with a timely report.
