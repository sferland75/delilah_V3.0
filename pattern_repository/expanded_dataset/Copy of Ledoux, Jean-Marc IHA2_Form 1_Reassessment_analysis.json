His professional practice began in 1998, when he graduated from the University of Ottawa’s School of Rehabilitation and began working as a registered Occupational Therapist in the private sector.  Over the years, Mr. Ferland has developed his clinical skills, and evolved to provide expert opinions in matters of human function  to stakeholders in the automobile insurance sector, personal injury and family law, the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (WSIB), Veterans Affairs and the Long-Term Disability sectors.  His opinions are sought by both plaintiff and defense counsel in the context of resolving matters in personal injury and family law cases.  He has been qualified several times as an expert in his field, providing testimony under oath in FSCO tribunals and cases appearing before the Ontario Superior Court of Justice.  \n\n\n\nMr. Ferland’s practice includes regular contributions to catastrophic designation assessment teams where he provides opinions related to daily function of individuals suffering from serious physical, psychological and cognitive impairments.  His assessments inform multidisciplinary team members (psychiatry, orthopedics, neurology, physiatry, psychology, etc.) of injured client’s daily functional capabilities at home, work and in the community, assisting them in forming opinions surrounding whether the catastrophic injury threshold is met.  \n\n\n\nMr. Ferland concurrently provides services as a treating Occupational Therapist to clients who have sustained physical and psychological trauma in motor vehicle accidents.  He has extensive experience in providing care to individuals suffering from chronic pain, depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress, overseeing and directing functional reactivation programs to foster improvements in function and participation in meaningful activity. \n\n\n\n\n\nPURPOSE OF REFERRAL:\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux was referred to the offices of Ferland & Associates Rehabilitation Inc. by his legal representative Ms. Elaine Lachaîne of Burn Tucker Lachaîne for an Occupational Therapy assessment and provision of OT services in relation to injuries he sustained in his accident of December 1, 2022 when he was hit by a vehicle as a pedestrian.   \n\n\n\nAt the request of his insurer, an OCF18 was submitted for funding of a reassessment of his attendant care needs and completion of a Form 1.  This OCF18 was approved and the following report serves to fulfill that mandate.\n\n\n\n\n\nSUMMARY OF FINDINGS:\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux was involved in a significant motor vehicle accident on December 1, 2022 when he was struck as a pedestrian, resulting in severe injuries to his right ankle (open fracture).  Since the date of loss, Mr. Ledoux has experienced a difficult recovery from this specific injury,  struggling with recurring infections and poor healing of open wounds on his left foot.  Concurrently, Mr. Ledoux continues to experience limitations in his left hand, resulting in an inability to utilize it for fine motor activities, such as playing musical instruments.  Mr. Ledoux has experienced a complete interruption in his normal life activities, leading to a deterioration of his mental health.  Mr. Ledoux continues to present with severe anxiety and existential preoccupations / suicidal ideation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcurrent with his accident-related impairments are a number of pre-existing medical and social issues including:\n\n\n\nIsolation (social)\n\nAnxiety disorder, unspecified\n\nBorderline personality disorder\n\nAdjustment disorder\n\nEssential tremor\n\nChronic pain\n\nDiabetes mellitus, type 2\n\nGERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)\n\nHTN (hypertension)\n\nSmoker\n\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\n\nBipolar disorder\n\nFamily history of DVT\n\nEpistaxis\n\nParkinsons\n\nSleep apnea\n\nAsthma\n\nDyslipidemia\n\nSleep apnea\n\n\n\nAs a result of these numerous medical issues, Mr. Ledoux has experienced a complicated recovery from the injuries sustained on the date of loss.  He remains dependent on assistance from PSW and Nursing to address ongoing issues relating to the management of his self-care, housekeeping and wound management.  He is also in receipt of services from RA Greg Goddard, who has assisted Mr. Ledoux in reconnecting with previously-enjoyed community outings and socialization.\n\n\n\nAt this time, Mr. Ledoux presents an ongoing need for Attendant Care, as depicted in the enclosed Assessment of Attendant Care Needs Form (Form 1).  He remains in need of significant daily assistance to manage his normal life activities, which he is largely precluded from performing, in any meaningful capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n\n\nAttendant Care:\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux is currently in need of 31.4 hours per week of Attendant Care to support him during his recovery by providing assistance for the management of those self-care activities listed in the Assessment of Attendant Care Needs Form (Form 1).    Total monthly attendant care benefit:  $2025.27/mth.\n\n\n\n\n\nINFORMED CONSENT STATEMENT:\n\n\n\nThis therapist has reviewed issues related to consent as per the requirements outlined by the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario:\n\n\n\nAn occupational therapy assessment is to be conducted by this therapist, a registered occupational therapist with the College of Occupational Therapists of Ontario (COTO).\n\nThe assessment has been requested by his legal representative Ms. Elaine Lachaîne.\n\nThe purpose of this assessment is to assess Mr. Ledoux’s current functional status as it relates to his ability to complete pre-accident activities of daily living.\n\nThe proposed assessment will include: an interview, a physical assessment and also observations of the ability to complete functional tasks within and around the home as well as education on safe means of completing activities of daily living if required.\n\nDue to the physical nature of the assessment, pain and fatigue are possible temporary side effects.\n\nRecommendations may be provided at the conclusion of the assessment.  These recommendations may include:\n\nOccupational Therapy Treatment\n\nAssistive Devices \n\nReferral to other practitioners\n\nSupport services\n\nA submission for funding will be submitted to the insurer for any goods and/or services on an OCF18 – Assessment and Treatment Plan.  The insurer may approve or deny the plan (in part or in whole).  Should a denial or partial denial occur, an independent examination by another Occupational Therapist may be requested by the insurer.  This may be an in-person assessment or a remote paper-review assessment.  Funding for the requested goods and/or services may ultimately be declined.\n\nMr. Ledoux may choose to participate or decline any or all of the proposed assessment.\n\nA report documenting this assessment will be completed and copies will be provided to the following parties via secure transmission (fax or encrypted email attachment):\n\nIntact Insurance c/o Karen Jenkins, Accident Benefits Adjuster\n\nBurn Tucker Lachaîne, c/o Elaine Lachaîne, Legal Representative\n\n\n\nFollowing this therapist’s explanation, Mr. Ledoux granted informed consent for this therapist to proceed with the assessment and any subsequent interventions. \n\n\n\n\n\nDOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:\n\n\n\nAt the time of this assessment, this therapist was provided with the following documentation: \n\n\n\nMedical Records from The Ottawa Hospital, 1423 pages\n\n\n\n\n\nPRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY:\n\n\n\nBased on the Admission Record from B2 - The Ottawa Hospital, Mr. LEdoux presents with the following pre-accident medical and social history:\n\n\n\nIsolation (social)\n\nAnxiety disorder, unspecified\n\nBorderline personality disorder\n\nAdjustment disorder\n\nEssential tremor\n\nChronic pain\n\nDiabetes mellitus, type 2\n\nGERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease)\n\nHTN (hypertension)\n\nSmoker\n\nCOPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease)\n\nBipolar disorder\n\nFamily history of DVT\n\nEpistaxis\n\nParkinsons\n\nSleep apnea\n\nAsthma\n\nDyslipidemia\n\nSleep apnea\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux also shared with this therapist that his longstanding history of mental health struggles led to a history of 2 suicide attempts (one at age 16 via CO asphyxiation and in his twenties through planned medication overdose).\n\n\n\n\n\nNATURE OF INJURY:\n\n\n\nOn December 1, 2022, Mr. Ledoux was a pedestrian struck by a motor vehicle resulting in significant orthopedic and lacerative injuries.  \n\n\n\nBased on this assessment and through a review of available medical records, Mr. Ledoux has sustained the following injuries as a result of the subject motor vehicle accident:\n\n\n\nLeft Medial Malleolus Fracture Open Reduction, Internal Fixation \n\nPatellar Open Reduction, Internal Fixation \n\nPost-surgical infarction requiring hardware removal February 2, 2023\n\nWound healing concerns and exposed bone requiring debridement, flap and skin grafts (with subsequent infections), March 18, 2023\n\n2 rib fractures\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux reports a marked decline in his mental health, including pronounced symptoms of anxiety and depression.

Mr. Ledoux describes a “crunching noise” when bearing weight on his left ankle. Although encouraged to walk regularly, his opportunities for walking are constrained by the limited space in his apartment and the need for assistance to leave his home.\n\n8/10 - 10/10\n\nLeft knee\n\nThis area remains quite painful, especially when ambulating.\n\n4/10 at rest, up to 8/10 when walking\n\nLeft hip\n\nRequires frequent repositioning while seated in his recliner.\n\n\n\n5/10 during the day up to 7/10 at night\n\nPelvis\n\nFrequent change of position required as he cannot obtain any relief from pelvic pain. \n\n7/10\n\nLeft hand\n\nUnable to fully bend his wrist or grasp with his second and third fingers. Limited fine motor coordination was evident during the assessment. Mr. Ledoux, a skilled keyboard player and enthusiastic musician, has been unable to play music since his accident. He reports that playing music, a highly meaningful activity for him, is now unattainable due to the restricted functionality of his left hand.\n\n7/10\n\nLeft leg and forearm\n\nHe experiences sensations he describes as \"nerve shocks\" traveling from his left ankle to his knee, and from his left wrist to his elbow.\n\n\n\n8/10\n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive Symptoms:\n\n\n\nWhen originally asked about changes in his cognitive function, Mr. Ledoux denied any significant alterations. Nevertheless, further questioning revealed a range of troubling cognitive symptoms, which may be linked to his deteriorating mental health and use of opioid medications for pain management. He reported being slower, forgetful, incapable of multitasking, and having considerable difficulties with organization and planning. These issues have been evident through the ongoing engagement with Mr. Ledoux and are being explored further through therapeutic touch points where mitigation strategies are being explored.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional Symptoms:\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux noted that he experiences ongoing emotional symptoms:\n\n\n\nDepression and anxiety\n\nLoss of interest in activities he previously enjoyed\n\nPanic attacks, recurrent\n\nLow mood, anhedonia\n\nSuicidal ideation\n\nSocial isolation.  Mr. Ledoux spends the majority of his time in his apartment where he sits on his recliner and watches television all day.  He is sharing his desire to continue with RA sessions with Mr. Goddard, who has been helpful in providing Mr. Ledoux with some community access and to support him with the management of daily issues identified.\n\n\n\n\n\nSymptom Management Strategies:\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux reported making use of the following strategies to manage his symptoms at this time:\n\n\n\nRest\n\nActivity avoidance\n\nMedication\n\n\n\n\n\nFUNCTIONAL AND BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATIONS:\n\n\n\nTolerances, Mobility and Transfers: \n\n\n\nActivity\n\nClient Report and Therapist Observations\n\nSitting and repositioning\n\nMr. Ledoux reports spending most of his day sitting or lying on his recliner sofa.  He is required to reposition himself regularly throughout the day and will independently get in and out of his sitting location.  He does this with significant difficulty but persists through the motions of completing these transfers as required.  \n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux remained seated in his sofa for periods of 30 minutes, interrupted by requests from this therapist to demonstrate various functional tasks.  He was observed shifting his weight frequently during his time spent seated.\n\nBed mobility\n\nMr. Ledoux reported that he is unable to sleep in his bed as he cannot keep his left leg elevated comfortably.  He can’t turn on his side due to hip pain and thus finds the bed to not be a useful surface for him to utilize at this time.   \n\n\n\nBed transfers were not observed during this assessment and will be revisited in rehabilitation initiatives geared at normalizing his sleep environment (return to his bedroom to retire at night) and sleep pattern (stabilize sleep-wake pattern by segmenting sleep environment from daytime environment).\n\nTransfers\n\nMr. Ledoux demonstrated the ability to independently transfer from a chair and sofa, although he struggled during these movements, occasionally stopping mid-transfer to stabilize himself. He relied heavily on his walker or cane for support while standing and displayed ongoing general instability on his feet.\n\n\n\nDuring a toilet transfer demonstration, Mr. Ledoux experienced difficulty with the low-level toilet. A raised toilet seat, previously installed by this therapist in his bathroom, proved beneficial as it aligns with the height of his sofa, aiding in easier transfers.\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux has been limited to sponge bathing since his accident, avoiding showering or bathing due to compromised skin integrity at his skin graft sites. The use of a transfer tub bench has been discussed and Mr. Ledoux has now requested that this item be provided as he feels ready to undertake showers.\n\nStanding\n\nBefore the accident, Mr. Ledoux reported no significant problems with sustained static or dynamic standing, although he did acknowledge occasional pain. He was able to carry out his daily routine without difficulty.\n\n\n\nCurrently, he reports being able to stand for only a few minutes at a time before needing to sit to recover. He describes himself as deconditioned and unable to maintain standing for any substantial duration.\n\n\n\nThis therapist observed Mr. Ledoux during short periods of static and dynamic standing. He was frequently seen shifting his weight from side to side and was rarely able to remain standing in one position for more than a few minutes.\n\nBalance\n\nStatic balance assessed using Four-Stage Balance Test, consisting of holding four different stances for at least 10 seconds each:\n\n\n\nwith his feet together\n\non one foot (right then left)\n\nwhile in a semi-tandem\n\nwhile tandem stance\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux was unable to demonstrate any of the above postures without external support from a walking aid.  He is found to remain at high risk for falls and encouraged to make use of available mobility aids at all times when standing upright.\n\nWalking\n\nOver the last four months, Mr. Ledoux's ability to walk has demonstrably deteriorated, a decline marked by increased instability, reliance on mobility aids, and frequent need for assistance. Initially capable of short, independent walks with minimal support, his endurance and steadiness have progressively weakened. This regression is characterized by an augmented unsteadiness, as noted during transfers and stair navigation, and an elevated risk of falls. Mr. Ledoux's outings, although regularly scheduled to promote mobility and engagement, have increasingly required meticulous planning to accommodate his diminished capabilities. His decreased tolerance for physical activity necessitates frequent breaks and substantial support from rehabilitation staff, highlighting a significant and ongoing decline in his functional mobility. This trend underscores the need for continued and possibly intensified occupational therapy interventions to manage his mobility constraints and enhance his quality of life.\n\nStairs\n\nMr. Ledoux remains unable to safely manage the three uneven steps at the front of his home which he continues to navigate when required, slowly and with much difficulty.  He has been observed to be unsteady while descending stairs, requiring close stand-by supervision as he continues to present with periods of unsteadiness required that he brace himself on surfaces.  This remains a significant impediment to increased community outings, which remain a targeted therapeutic goal at this time.\n\nLifting/Carrying\n\nMr. Ledoux is significantly limited in his ability to carry objects while utilizing mobility aids due to impairments in his left arm. When navigating with a rollator walker, he can transport small items within his apartment by placing them on the walker's seat pan. However, his capacity for grip is severely compromised; he is unable to exert substantial force with his left hand. A functional assessment revealed that only his thumb, fourth, and fifth digits retain some ability to apply a cylindrical grip, as demonstrated during interactions with this therapist. This limitation affects his functional independence and necessitates adaptations in his living environment and daily routines to accommodate his reduced manual dexterity.\n\nKneeling\n\nWas able to kneel with some discomfort pre-accident.\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux is unable to kneel at this time.  \n\nSquatting/Crouching\n\nWas able to squat and crouch with some discomfort pre-accident.\n\n\n\nHe is currently unable to squat or crouch.  \n\nBending\n\nMr. Ledoux is able to bend forward while seated to reach his toes.   He cannot bend forward when standing. \n\nReaching\n\nMr. Ledoux exhibits significant limitations in reaching with his left arm due to restricted mobility in his left shoulder, which presents with approximately 50% of normal active range of motion (ROM) in all planes. This substantial reduction impacts his ability to perform daily tasks that require arm extension or elevation. In contrast, his right upper extremity remains fully functional, allowing him to compensate for some of the deficits on his left side. This disparity in functional ability between his limbs necessitates specific therapeutic interventions aimed at improving his left shoulder's ROM while also strategizing daily activities to utilize his right arm's capabilities effectively.\n\nFine Motor Coordination\n\nMr. Ledoux demonstrates considerable challenges with fine motor coordination in his left hand, particularly evident in his inability to effectively move his index through ring fingers for fine gripping tasks. This limitation was informally observed during activities such as handling coins, where Mr. Ledoux was unable to manipulate individual pieces using his left hand and instead relied predominantly on his right hand. This dependency on his right hand for fine motor tasks highlights a significant impairment in his left hand's dexterity and functional use, necessitating targeted interventions to enhance his fine motor skills and adapt his environment to better accommodate his current capabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nActive Range of Motion:\n\nLegend:\n\nWFL: \t\tWithin Functional Limits\n\n%: \t\tapproximate percentage of normal range\n\nNominal: \tless than 25% range\n\nMovement\n\nRight\n\nLeft\n\nComments\n\nNeck\n\nForward flexion\n\nWFL\n\nWhile Mr. Ledoux retains a generally preserved range of motion in his neck, he reports experiencing stiffness and pain during active movements and even while in a neutral position.\n\nLateral flexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nRotation\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nShoulder\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nLeft shoulder range of motion significantly impaired in all planes.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nAbduction\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nAdduction\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nInternal rotation\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nExternal rotation\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nElbow\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nNo identified limitations.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nWrist\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nNo identified limitations.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nSupination\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nPronation\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nTrunk\n\nForward flexion\n\n½ range\n\nMr. Ledoux is significantly restricted in his ability to bend forward and reach beyond his upper thighs due to severe pain in his lumbar spine. This limitation severely impacts his functional capabilities, affecting daily activities that require bending or reaching low, such as dressing or picking up objects from the ground.\n\nLateral flexion\n\n½ range\n\n½ range\n\nRotation\n\n½ range\n\n½ range\n\nHip\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nNo identified limitations.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nKnee\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nUnable to fully straighten or bend his left knee.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\n¾ range\n\nAnkle\n\nDorsiflexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nNo identified limitations.\n\nPlantar flexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmotional Presentation:\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux’s emotional presentation has been observed as generally flat and somber.  He noted a recent medical finding leading to an imminent surgery for the removal of masses in his abdomen.  This additional stress has had a negative impact on Mr. Ledoux’s mood and compounded his depressive symptoms and those of severe anxiety.  He was also observed to be preoccupied by a recent contact from his employer, which has triggered increased anxiety requiring intervention by this therapist.    \n\n\n\n\n\nCognitive Presentation:\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux presented with generally intact cognition during this assessment.  He does continue to be avoidant of various cognitively demanding tasks such as problem solving and organization, and noted receiving assistance by his PSW to sort his mail and help him prioritize the correspondences.  He does also present with evident signs of cognitive fatigue, prevalent at all times and more pronounced as he becomes tired or when pain symptoms increase.  He also presents with signs of slowed cognitive processing, as he requires time to process information before providing a response.\n\n\n\n\n\nTYPICAL DAY:\n\n\n\nMr. Ledoux reported little change in his daily routine over the past year, as he continues to manage his medical complications.  He remains socially isolated and largely confined to his apartment due to his severe mobility restrictions and deconditioning.  He spends his days and nights in his recliner where he will watch television and attempt to keep himself distracted from his pain and negative thoughts.  With the assistance of his RA, Mr. Ledoux has been able to engage in a number of community outings which he finds deeply gratifying.  He notes that without someone to help him, he is unable to leave his apartment and has no meaningful activities to occupy his time.  He notes particular benefits from having returned to the park to feed animals and attending a local Tim Hortons for a coffee.  \n\n\n\n\n\nDESCRIPTION OF LIVING ENVIRONMENT:\n\n\n\nTYPE OF DWELLING\n\nApartment, main floor, outdoor access via two concrete steps in disrepair\n\nROOMS\n\nQty\n\nLOCATION/DESCRIPTION\n\nFLOOR COVERING\n\nBedrooms\n\n1\n\nMain floor\n\nLaminate\n\nBathrooms\n\n1\n\nMain floor\n\nTile\n\nLiving Room\n\n1\n\nMain floor\n\nLaminate\n\nFamily Room\n\n0\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nDining Room\n\n0\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nKitchen \n\n1\n\nRound table and 4 chairs in the kitchen\n\nLaminate\n\nLaundry\n\n1\n\nWasher and dryer located in the kitchen\n\nLaminate\n\nStairs\n\n2\n\nTwo steps in state of disrepair and not meeting code requirements to be navigated to access his main floor apartment.

The Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists report “Considerations for Occupational Therapists Completing an Assessment of Attendant Care Needs (Form 1)” was consulted for the completion of the assessment. As per the OSOT Guidelines, “this assessment of Attendant Care Needs (Form 1) is not simply the recording of what attendant care services are already in place. This therapist’s role is to determine the extent to which the client can perform the skills and activities identified in the Form 1 safely, functionally, and to objectively identify what assistance, if any, is needed from the present time into the future until another such re-assessment may identify modified needs.” \n\n\n\nPart 1 – Level 1 Attendant Care (Routine personal care)\n\n\n\nTask\n\nObservations/Comments\n\nWeekly Time Allotted\n\nDress\n\nUpper body\n\nLower Body\n\nMr. Ledoux demonstrated the strength, range of motion and postural tolerances required to manage dressing and undressing activities independently.  He confirmed that he manages this task independently albeit in a slow manner at times with breaks if symptoms are flared.\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nUndress\n\nUpper body\n\nLower Body\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nProsthetics\n\nNA\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nOrthotics\n\nNA\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nGrooming\n\nFace\n\nHands\n\nShaving\n\nCosmetics\n\nBrush/shampoo/dry/style hair\n\nFingernails\n\nToenails\n\nMr. Ledoux requires assistance with hair care, fingernail and toenail care.\n\n65 minutes per week\n\nFeeding\n\nMr. Ledoux is unable to prepare meals for himself and requires assistance with all aspects of meal preparation.\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nMobility *\n\nMr. Ledoux would benefit from assistance to walk outside of his home for short periods three times daily.\n\n420 minutes per week\n\nExtra Laundering\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\n* Please note that as per the guidelines set forth by the Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists, assistance with mobility includes “all transfers both inside the home and out in the community” and “supervision and assistance when walking includes: stair climbing, mobility on ramps, into and out of home and/or lobby, garage, in the community etc.”\n\n\n\nPart 2 – Level 2 Attendant Care (Basic supervisory functions)\n\n\n\nTask\n\nObservations/Comments\n\nWeekly Time Allotted\n\nHygiene *\n\nClean tub/shower/ sink after use\n\nChange bedding, make bed, clean room\n\nEnsure comfort and safety (bedroom)\n\nAssist in daily wearing apparel\n\nHand/sort clothes to be laundered\n\nMr. Ledoux requires assistance with the management of all hygiene tasks listed in this section of the Form 1.  He is confined to his apartment and benefits from a 2 hours per day of assistance for ensuring his comfort and security in his environment through a combination of phone check-ins and in-person visits.  \n\n1015 minutes per week\n\nBasic Supervisory Care **\n\nNo needs identified at this time for this section.  This will be monitored through the course of OT treatment delivery. \n\n0 minutes per week\n\nCoordination of Attendant Care\n\n\n\n0 minutes per week\n\n\n\n* The “Assessment of Attendant Care Needs” guidelines set forth by the Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists considers “supervisory functions for those who are emotionally, cognitively and/or physically in need of comfort (e.g. advocating for a child or someone who is cognitively impaired)”. The OSOT guidelines further state that the “family may be ensuring comfort, safety and security in this (hospital) environment and these activities should be considered an attendant care need under Level 2”.\n\n\n\n** As per the National Research Counsel of Canada (2006), the Available Safe Escape Time (ASET) for a single-family house equipped with smoke alarms, may only be 3 minutes. The Required Safe Escape Time (RSET) is the amount of time required for an individual to evacuate or reach an area of safety. Factors that impact the ability to evacuate quickly include age, sleep stage (those in deep stages have more difficulty being roused), drugs (e.g., individuals taking a sleeping aid} and alcohol consumption, and those who have physical and mental disabilities. In Canada, winter conditions must also be considered, as “preparation for further action” activities including donning boots and coats, and gathering belongings, require additional time.\n\n\n\nPart 3 – Level 3 Attendant Care (Complex health/care and hygiene functions)\n\n\n\nTask\n\nObservations/Comments\n\nWeekly Time Allotted\n\nGenitourinary Tracts\n\nNo needs identified.\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nBowel Care\n\nNo needs identified.\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nTracheostomy\n\nNot applicable.\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nVentilator Care\n\nNot applicable.\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nExercise\n\nNo exercise program prescribed yet.\n\n0 minutes per week\n\nSkin Care\n\nCCAC is currently managing skin care issues. \n\n0 minutes per week\n\nMedication\n\nMr. Ledoux is independent in the management of his medication.

He notes receiving one weekly CCAC visit from a PSW as well as 2 - 3 weekly visits from a PSW who has retired but continues to work with Mr. Ledoux with whom she has developed a strong bond and provides services privately.  \n\nIn addition, Mr. Ledoux also continues to receive CCAC nursing care once every 4 days for dressing changes to his left foot.\n\nHome Management Activities:\n\nLegend of Ability:\n\nI – Independent    A – Partial with assistance     D – With devices    U – Unable    NA – Not Applicable\n\nIndoor Tasks\n\nPre-accident Engagement\n\nCurrent Engagement\n\nMeal Preparation",
    "FUNCTIONAL_STATUS": "Mr. Ledoux exhibits significant limitations in reaching with his left arm due to restricted mobility in his left shoulder, which presents with approximately 50% of normal active range of motion (ROM) in all planes. This substantial reduction impacts his ability to perform daily tasks that require arm extension or elevation. In contrast, his right upper extremity remains fully functional, allowing him to compensate for some of the deficits on his left side. This disparity in functional ability between his limbs necessitates specific therapeutic interventions aimed at improving his left shoulder's ROM while also strategizing daily activities to utilize his right arm's capabilities effectively.\n\nFine Motor Coordination\n\nMr. Ledoux demonstrates considerable challenges with fine motor coordination in his left hand, particularly evident in his inability to effectively move his index through ring fingers for fine gripping tasks. This limitation was informally observed during activities such as handling coins, where Mr. Ledoux was unable to manipulate individual pieces using his left hand and instead relied predominantly on his right hand. This dependency on his right hand for fine motor tasks highlights a significant impairment in his left hand's dexterity and functional use, necessitating targeted interventions to enhance his fine motor skills and adapt his environment to better accommodate his current capabilities.\n\nActive Range of Motion:\n\nLegend:\n\nWFL: \t\tWithin Functional Limits\n\n%: \t\tapproximate percentage of normal range\n\nNominal: \tless than 25% range\n\nMovement\n\nRight\n\nLeft\n\nComments\n\nNeck\n\nForward flexion\n\nWFL\n\nWhile Mr. Ledoux retains a generally preserved range of motion in his neck, he reports experiencing stiffness and pain during active movements and even while in a neutral position.\n\nLateral flexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nRotation\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nShoulder\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nLeft shoulder range of motion significantly impaired in all planes.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nAbduction\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nAdduction\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nInternal rotation\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nExternal rotation\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nElbow\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nNo identified limitations.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nWrist\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nNo identified limitations.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nSupination\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nPronation\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nTrunk\n\nForward flexion\n\n½ range",

    "TYPICAL_DAY": "Mr. Ledoux reported little change in his daily routine over the past year, as he continues to manage his medical complications.  He remains socially isolated and largely confined to his apartment due to his severe mobility restrictions and deconditioning.  He spends his days and nights in his recliner where he will watch television and attempt to keep himself distracted from his pain and negative thoughts.  With the assistance of his RA, Mr. Ledoux has been able to engage in a number of community outings which he finds deeply gratifying.  He notes that without someone to help him, he is unable to leave his apartment and has no meaningful activities to occupy his time.  He notes particular benefits from having returned to the park to feed animals and attending a local Tim Hortons for a coffee.  \n\nDESCRIPTION OF LIVING ENVIRONMENT:\n\nTYPE OF DWELLING\n\nApartment, main floor, outdoor access via two concrete steps in disrepair\n\nROOMS\n\nQty\n\nLOCATION/DESCRIPTION\n\nFLOOR COVERING\n\nBedrooms\n\n1\n\nMain floor\n\nLaminate\n\nBathrooms\n\n1\n\nMain floor\n\nTile\n\nLiving Room\n\n1\n\nMain floor\n\nLaminate\n\nFamily Room\n\n0\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nDining Room\n\n0\n\nNA\n\nNA\n\nKitchen \n\n1\n\nRound table and 4 chairs in the kitchen\n\nLaminate\n\nLaundry\n\n1\n\nWasher and dryer located in the kitchen\n\nLaminate\n\nStairs\n\n2\n\nTwo steps in state of disrepair and not meeting code requirements to be navigated to access his main floor apartment.

      "notes": "Mr. Ledoux exhibits significant limitations in reaching with his left arm due to restricted mobility in his left shoulder, which presents with approximately 50% of normal active range of motion (ROM) in all planes. This substantial reduction impacts his ability to perform daily tasks that require arm extension or elevation. In contrast, his right upper extremity remains fully functional, allowing him to compensate for some of the deficits on his left side. This disparity in functional ability between his limbs necessitates specific therapeutic interventions aimed at improving his left shoulder's ROM while also strategizing daily activities to utilize his right arm's capabilities effectively.\n\nFine Motor Coordination\n\nMr. Ledoux demonstrates considerable challenges with fine motor coordination in his left hand, particularly evident in his inability to effectively move his index through ring fingers for fine gripping tasks. This limitation was informally observed during activities such as handling coins, where Mr. Ledoux was unable to manipulate individual pieces using his left hand and instead relied predominantly on his right hand. This dependency on his right hand for fine motor tasks highlights a significant impairment in his left hand's dexterity and functional use, necessitating targeted interventions to enhance his fine motor skills and adapt his environment to better accommodate his current capabilities.\n\nActive Range of Motion:\n\nLegend:\n\nWFL: \t\tWithin Functional Limits\n\n%: \t\tapproximate percentage of normal range\n\nNominal: \tless than 25% range\n\nMovement\n\nRight\n\nLeft\n\nComments\n\nNeck\n\nForward flexion\n\nWFL\n\nWhile Mr. Ledoux retains a generally preserved range of motion in his neck, he reports experiencing stiffness and pain during active movements and even while in a neutral position.\n\nLateral flexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nRotation\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nShoulder\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nLeft shoulder range of motion significantly impaired in all planes.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nAbduction\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nAdduction\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nInternal rotation\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nExternal rotation\n\nWFL\n\n½ range\n\nElbow\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nNo identified limitations.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nWrist\n\nFlexion\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nNo identified limitations.\n\nExtension\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nSupination\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nPronation\n\nWFL\n\nWFL\n\nTrunk\n\nForward flexion\n\n½ range",
