Bed   Independent   Independent   with   signi fi cant  di ffi culty and pain.  Ms.   Balduzzi   demonstrated  one   bed   transfer   at   this  therapist’s   request.   Bed  transfers   were   performed  with   signi fi cant   di ffi culty  due   to   the   high   bed   surface  and   the   so \u0000   nature   of   the  ma \u0000 ress.

She   will   place   her  lifeline   system   at   the   side   of  the   bathtub   as   a   security  measure,   should   she   require  assistance.  Ms.   Balduzzi’s   current  strategy   of   showering   when  alone   at   home,   without   any  assis \u0000 ve   devices,   is   found   to  be   an   unsafe   prac \u0000 ce.   She   is  at   high   risk   of   falls   and  injury.   Her   bathroom  environment   requires  modi fi ca \u0000 ons   to   allow   safe  showering   tasks.

She   is  required   to   navigate   the   ledge   of   the   bathtub,   being   mindful   not   to   trip   and   fall.   She   reports  showering   while   standing,   and   placing   her   lifeline   system   at   the   side   of   the   tub   in   case   she  requires   assistance.   Due   to   Ms.   Balduzzi’s   poor   mobility,   it   is   this   therapist’s   professional   opinion  that   her   current   bathroom   environment   is   unsafe   and   requires   modi fi ca \u0000 on   to   foster  independence, and most importantly, safety.  In   this   therapist’s   opinion,   Ms.   Balduzzi   would   bene fi t   from   the   modi fi ca \u0000 on   of   her   bathroom  environment   to   introduce   a   sloped   shower   stall   enclosure,   which   Ms.   Balduzzi   could   access  without   the   need   to   navigate   a   bathtub   ledge.   This   would   further   allow   her   to   sit   on   a  showering   accessory   chair   mounted   in   the   enclosure   to   reduce   the   risks   of   slips   and   falls.   A  contractor will be contacted to ini \u0000 ate a proposal on this home modi fi ca \u0000 on front.  Kitchen:  Ms.   Balduzzi   has   noted   a   progressive   decline   in   her   ability   to   reach   for   glasses   and   plates   located  in   the   upper   cabinets   of   her   kitchen.   Her   bilateral   shoulder   issues   and   arm   pain   are   impac \u0000 ng  her   ability   to   e ff ec \u0000 vely   reach   above   shoulder   level.   Addi \u0000 onally,   Ms.   Balduzzi   presents  di ffi cul \u0000 es   surrounding   sustained   standing,   and   could   bene fi t   from   the   use   of   a   task   chair   to  foster   her   sustained   engagement   in   dishwashing   tasks.   She   would   also   bene fi t   from  considera \u0000 on to replace her kitchen chair with one more suited to her body dimensions.  Bedroom:  Ms.   Balduzzi’s   bed   is   currently   no   longer   suitable   to   meet   her   comfort   and   transfer   needs.   Bed  transfers   have   reportedly   been   the   source   of   injuries   to   her   right   shoulder,   and   aggrava \u0000 on   of  her   le \u0000   shoulder   pain.   This   has   further   compounded   the   challenges   posed   by   comple \u0000 ng   a   bed  transfer   on   her   current   bed   system.   Ms   Balduzzi   would   bene fi t   from   the   use   of   an   adjustable  bed,   which   would   facilitate   transfers   and   bed   mobility.   A   replacement   ma \u0000 ress   is   also   required  as   Ms.   Balduzzi’s   current   ma \u0000 ress   is   too   so \u0000   and   lacking   support.   A   visit   to   Sleep   Country  Canada   will   be   ini \u0000 ated   to   trial   various   op \u0000 ons,   an   OCF18   will   be   submi \u0000 ed   to   the   insurer   for  considera \u0000 on.  Basement Access:  Ms.   Balduzzi   noted   that   she   has   been   unable   to   access   her   basement   which   has   led   to  frustra \u0000 ons   with   being   unable   to   change   her   furnace   fi lter   or   check   on   the   overall   state   of   her  home.   She   noted   an   episode   in   the   last   years   where   her   basement   fl ooded   and   she   was  unaware   this   had   occurred.   This   resulted   in   signi fi cant   damage,   compounding   Ms.   Balduzzi’s  ______________________________________________________________________________  Mary Balduzzi   Claim #: APP2699699   Page   13   of   14\n\nDate of Report: 2023-12-08  insistence   that   a   li \u0000 /elevator   system   be   installed   in   her   home   to   allow   her   unrestricted   access   to  the basement environment.
