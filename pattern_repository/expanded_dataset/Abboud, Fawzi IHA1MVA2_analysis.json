His assessments inform multidisciplinary  team   members   (psychiatry, orthopedics, neurology, physiatry, psychology, etc.) of injured  client’s daily functional capabilities at home, work and in the community, assisting them in  forming opinions surrounding whether the catastrophic injury threshold is met.  Mr. Ferland concurrently provides services as a treating Occupational Therapist to clients who  have sustained physical and psychological trauma in motor vehicle accidents. He has extensive  experience in providing care to individuals suffering from chronic pain, depression, anxiety and  posttraumatic   stress,   overseeing   and   directing   functional   reactivation programs to foster  improvements in function and participation in meaningful activity.  PURPOSE OF REFERRAL :  Mr. Abboud was assessed by this therapist over two sessions held on November 28 and  December 5, 2023 at the request of his legal representative, Mr. Frank McNally. The purpose of  this assessment is to provide an updated outline of Mr. Abboud’s overall function as it relates to  injuries sustained in the subject MVA. An OCF18 for this assessment was submitted on  December 15, 2023 to the insurer for consideration. This OCF18 remained under adjudication  at the time of drafting this report.  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:  Mr. Abboud was involved in his first MVA on September 2, 2013 when the vehicle he was driving  was rear-ended by a transport truck. As a result of this accident, Mr. Abboud was diagnosed  with the following injuries and associated sequelae:  ●   Left knee meniscal injury and osteochondral injury  ●   Right knee meniscal injury with possible osteochondral injury  ●   Chronic myofascial strain to the neck (cervical spine)  ●   Chronic myofascial strain to the back (lumbar spine)  ●   Posttraumatic Stress Disorder  ●   Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress  ●   Somatic Symptom Disorder  As a result of this accident, Mr. Abboud developed physical symptoms (headaches/dizziness,  neck pain, elbow pain, lower back pain, bilateral knee pain, spasms in his calves, loss of hand  strength/dexterity) as well as significant emotional and cognitive symptoms. Mr. Abboud has  seen his general condition deteriorate over the years leading to a clinical presentation which  impacts his engagement in all aspects of daily function. He managed self-care with difficulty,  was unable to manage housekeeping tasks and was unable to work in the capacity he did  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 2 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  pre-accident, (or in any sustained capacity in this therapist’s opinion). Mr Abboud’s relationship  with his children was also deeply impacted by the changes in his function.  Mr. Abboud was involved in another MVA on May 29, 2019 which resulted in an aggravation of  all pre-existing physical issues and most importantly, a severe deterioration of his mental health.  He is no longer working in any capacity and has functionally deteriorated to a point of spending  the bulk of his days lying on the sofa sleeping or watching news on the television. He is  displaying concerning patterns of self-harm which include hitting himself, striking his head on  the wall and biting himself to the point of leaving visible marks. He is also reporting increased  suicidal thinking which has been noted by his treating psychologist.  Mr. Abboud is in need of ongoing Occupational Therapy treatment on a weekly to bi-weekly  basis to provide him with the support he requires to integrate gains in his daily function. Mr.  Abboud would also benefit from the introduction of a Rehabilitation Support Worker to support  Occupational Therapy goals and provide Mr. Abboud with increased therapeutic intervention  frequency.  Mr.   Abboud   would also benefit from ongoing and uninterrupted access to psychological  treatment and access to kinesiology treatments to mitigate deconditioning.   His precarious  mental health status is concerning and requires ongoing, regular monitoring by a team of  qualified rehabilitation professionals.  RECOMMENDATIONS:  Further Occupational Therapy Interventions:  Mr. Abboud is in need of ongoing Occupational Therapy treatment. He requires involvement of  Occupational Therapy on a weekly to bi-weekly basis to provide him with the support he  requires to integrate gains in his daily function.  Mr. Abboud would also benefit from the introduction of a Rehabilitation Support Worker to  support   Occupational Therapy goals and provide Mr. Abboud with increased therapeutic  intervention frequency.  Assistive Devices:  Mr. Abboud is currently sleeping on a mattress positioned on the floor of the childrens’  playroom. He experiences poor sleep and difficulties completing transfers. Mr. Abboud would  benefit from the introduction of a replacement bed system with consideration to an adjustable  base to foster improvements in the quality of his sleep, as well as to facilitate transfers from his  bed surface.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 3 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  Referral for Other Services:  Mr. Abboud would benefit from the introduction of physical therapy and psychological care to  foster improvements in his physical function and emotional wellbeing. He would also benefit  from   the   introduction   of   kinesiology   treatments   to develop an appropriate conditioning  program to support functional reactivation goals proposed as part of OT treatment.

When not at work, he was actively involved in sports such as soccer, swimming and  running. He noted that he rarely got sick, and never took time off other than to go to Lebanon  for a trip every three years.   He was involved in his first MVA in 2013, when his vehicle was  rear-ended by a transport truck, resulting in the following injuries:  ●   Left knee meniscal injury and osteochondral injury  ●   Right knee meniscal injury with possible osteochondral injury  ●   Chronic myofascial strain to the neck (cervical spine)  ●   Chronic myofascial strain to the back (lumbar spine)  ●   Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder  ●   Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress  ●   Somatic Symptom Disorder  Mr. Abboud has experienced a difficult course of recovery from these injuries, which left him  with significant residual mobility issues impacting his overall function. Additionally, he has  experienced an array of psychological symptoms resulting in a deterioration of his mood. He  was continuing to recover from these injuries at the time of the subject MVA. He was required  to close his restaurant in March of 2020 as he was no longer able to operate his business. He  made some efforts to continue working part-time hours with another shawarma restaurant  owned by a friend but was required to stop working in November of 2022.  MECHANISM OF INJURY:  Mr. Abboud stated that he was the only occupant wearing a seat belt in his vehicle during a  collision on the evening of May 29, 2019, while on his way to work. At the time of the collision,  he was stationary at a red light near Hunt Club and Tim Hortons at Bowesville/Paul Benoit  Driveway. He was rear-ended by another vehicle. The impact caused his head and neck to be  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 6 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  thrown, and his knees to strike the steering wheel, resulting in immediate pain in his head,  neck, shoulders, back, and knees. He did not anticipate the collision and was disoriented and  shocked when it happened. Mr. Abboud was visibly distressed and tearful while recounting the  event, noting that it triggered flashbacks to a previous collision in September 2013. He felt  extremely upset, fearful, and shaky, and contacted his wife for assistance. He later got out of his  vehicle, which sustained considerable trunk damage. The airbags did not deploy.  Mr. Abboud, who did not possess a cell phone, used the other driver's phone to call his wife and  believes the other driver contacted the police. He was advised to report to a police station, as  no   police,   fire,   or   medical   personnel   arrived   at   the   scene.   Post-accident,   Mr.   Abboud  experienced considerable pain, stiffness, anxiety, tearfulness, shakiness, and nightmares. He  consulted his family doctor shortly thereafter, who recommended physiotherapy and massage  therapy.

He  displayed significant physical discomfort, including pronounced limping, grimacing, and visible  inflammation in both knees, which were swollen, red, and warm. His physical limitations have  severely impacted his work capacity, household management, and interaction with his children.  At present, Mr. Abboud is struggling to cope. He was observed tearing up multiple times and on  certain instances broke down crying, particularly when discussing the passing of his father,  whom he hadn't visited for years due to financial constraints. This has caused him profound  guilt. Additionally, he became extremely agitated when discussing suicidal thoughts, mentioning  that the presence of his wife and children is the sole factor preventing him from taking his own  life.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 16 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  Cognitive Presentation:  Mr.   Abboud   has   relied heavily on his wife, Rania, to provide details surrounding dates,  timeframes, and names of providers, as he appeared to struggle to recall these details.

ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING (Pre and Post Accident):  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 17 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  Pre and Post Accident Self-Care Activities:  Prior to his accident, Mr. Abboud was generally independent in his performance of all self-care  activities. He noted that he did perform these tasks with difficulty and this resulted in increased  pain. He noted the following challenges with respect to self-care:  ●   His wife needed to be nearby when he showers due to concerns over falls  ●   “It takes forever to get ready in the morning.” His wife noted that she and the children  would become impatient waiting for him to get ready to leave in the morning.  ●   He demonstrated his ability to remove his socks but was unable to put them back on due  to high pain levels.  ●   He slips on his shoes and will not pull the heel over his foot. This results in footwear  damage.  Mr. Abboud was otherwise independent in his performance of all self-care functions.  At the time of this assessment, Mr. Abboud indicated that he experienced increased difficulties  managing many self-care functions.   He now will not shower unless his wife is present.   He  experiences difficulty with managing dressing, particularly, zippers, socks and footwear. He no  longer partakes in any meal preparation and relies on his wife for the management of all  financial affairs.   He is often unable to open jars due to pain in his hands, noting increased  difficulty with bending his fingers and using his hands forcefully.  Please refer to the Attendant Care section of this report for more information.  Pre and Post Accident Home Management Activities:  Prior to the 2013 accident, Mr. Abboud was responsible for almost all indoor and outdoor  housekeeping and home maintenance activities. Mr. Abboud noted that he grew up in a large  family and was required to manage household chores with his siblings. In his marriage to his  wife Rania, Mr. Abboud has taken responsibility for all indoor housekeeping and outdoor home  maintenance tasks while she managed child care and dinner meal preparation.  At the time of the subject MVA of May 2019, Mr. Abboud had not resumed engagement in his  housekeeping and home maintenance responsibilities.   He indicated that his mother-in-law  would come to the home almost daily to bring food, help with housekeeping and interact with  the kids.  Following his 2019 MVA, Mr. Abboud noted that he is now completely dependent on his wife in  regards to the management of their household.   He no longer prepares food for the family  (which he would routinely do at his restaurant), and now relies on food prepared by his wife to  sustain himself during the day when he is not sleeping.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 18 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  Pre and Post Accident Caregiving Activities:  Mr. Abboud has experienced a gradual decrease in the quality and quantity of his interactions  with his children.   He noted that with his son especially, the relationship has been deeply  impacted by his physical and psychological struggles. He noted that he tends to keep to himself  much more than before and is often criticized by his son for his lack of engagement and inability  to provide. His wife Rania remains the primary caregiver at this time.  Pre and Post Accident Vocational Activities:  Prior to his accident, Mr. Abboud noted that he worked 10 – 12 hours per day from Monday to  Saturday and would also work 4 hours on Sundays. He managed all aspects of his Shawarma  restaurant including prep work, cooking, customer service, inventory and cleaning.  In March of 2020, Mr. Abboud was forced to close his restaurant, this was a highly distressing  experience for him. He noted that he took a part-time job with another Shawarma restaurant  where he would work a few hours each day in order to provide in some way to the family  finances. He noted that he would obtain food from the restaurant which he would bring home  regularly for his family.  Mr. Abboud provided notice to his current employer that he is unable to continue working and  provided a November 1, 2022 date to end his engagement in the workplace.   The physical  impact of his workplace attendance and the resultant effects on his mood cannot be overstated.  Mr. Abboud persisted to remain employed due to his strong desire to provide for his wife and  children, and the process of realizing that he can no longer continue has been emotionally  devastating.  Pre and Post Accident Leisure Activities:  Prior to his 2013 accident, Mr. Abboud reported that he engaged in a number of leisure  activities such as various sports (including soccer, swimming, running). He was also active with  his son, whom he would take to the park on a regular basis to play.  Following his 2013 accident, Mr. Abboud noted that he was no longer able to engage in any  form of leisure activity. He has no meaningful activity to occupy his time.  He remains in a state of functional decompensation where he spends the bulk of his time either  sitting or lying on the sofa, watching television or sleeping.   He no longer participates in any  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 19 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  form of leisure activity and has found no replacement meaningful activities. This compounds  the emotional struggles he is experiencing.  ASSESSMENT OF ATTENDANT CARE NEEDS:  The following is an Assessment of Attendant Care Needs based on reports of the client and  direct observations as of November 24, 2023. The Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists  report “Considerations for Occupational Therapists Completing an Assessment of Attendant  Care Needs (Form 1)” was consulted for the completion of the assessment. As per the OSOT  Guidelines, “this assessment of Attendant Care Needs (Form 1) is not simply the recording of  what attendant care services are already in place. [This therapist’s] role is to determine the  extent to which the client can perform the skills and activities identified in the Form 1 safely,  functionally, and to objectively identify what assistance if any is needed from the present time  into the future until another such re-assessment may identify modified needs.”  Part 1 – Level 1 Attendant Care (Routine personal care)  Task   Observations/Comments   Weekly Time Allotted  Dress  •   Upper body  •   Lower Body  Mr.   Abboud   requires  assistance on a daily basis for  the management of dressing.

Feeding   Mr.   Abboud   is   unable   to  manage meal preparation at  this   time   as   a   result   of  physical limitations and poor  mental health. His wife Rania  prepares   all   meals   for   the  household.  210 minutes per week.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 20 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  Mobility   *   Mr.   Abboud   remains  independent   with   his  mobility needs.  0 minutes per week.  Extra Laundering   There are no extra laundering  requirements at this time.  0 minutes per week.  * Please note that as per the guidelines set forth by the Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists, assistance  with mobility includes “all transfers both inside the home and out in the community” and “supervision and  assistance when walking includes: stair climbing, mobility on ramps, into and out of home and/or lobby, garage,  in the community etc.”  Part 2 – Level 2 Attendant Care (Basic supervisory functions)  Task   Observations/Comments   Weekly Time Allotted  Hygiene   *  •   Clean tub/shower/ sink  after use  •   Change bedding, make  bed, clean room  •   Ensure comfort and safety  (bedroom)  •   Assist in daily wearing  apparel  •   Hand/sort clothes to be  laundered  Mr.   Abboud   is   unable   to  manage   the   bathroom   and  bedroom   environment.

Coordination of Attendant  Care  There are no Attendant Care  coordination requirements at  this time.  0 minutes per week.  * The “Assessment of Attendant Care Needs” guidelines set forth by the Ontario Society of Occupational  Therapists considers “supervisory functions for those who are emotionally, cognitively and/or physically in need  of comfort (e.g. advocating for a child or someone who is cognitively impaired)”. The OSOT guidelines further  state that the “family may be ensuring comfort, safety and security in this (hospital) environment and these  activities should be considered an attendant care need under Level 2”.  ** As per the National Research Counsel of Canada (2006), the Available Safe Escape Time (ASET) for a  single-family house equipped with smoke alarms, may only be 3 minutes. The Required Safe Escape Time (RSET)  is the amount of time required for an individual to evacuate or reach an area of safety. Factors that impact the  ability to evacuate quickly include age, sleep stage (those in deep stages have more difficulty being roused),  drugs (e.g., individuals taking a sleeping aid} and alcohol consumption, and those who have physical and mental  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 21 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  disabilities.

When not at work, he was actively involved in sports such as soccer, swimming and  running. He noted that he rarely got sick, and never took time off other than to go to Lebanon  for a trip every three years.

      "symptomNotes": "Date of Report: 2024-01-03  Pre and Post Accident Self-Care Activities:  Prior to his accident, Mr. Abboud was generally independent in his performance of all self-care  activities. He noted that he did perform these tasks with difficulty and this resulted in increased  pain. He noted the following challenges with respect to self-care:  ●   His wife needed to be nearby when he showers due to concerns over falls  ●   “It takes forever to get ready in the morning.” His wife noted that she and the children  would become impatient waiting for him to get ready to leave in the morning.  ●   He demonstrated his ability to remove his socks but was unable to put them back on due  to high pain levels.  ●   He slips on his shoes and will not pull the heel over his foot. This results in footwear  damage.  Mr. Abboud was otherwise independent in his performance of all self-care functions.  At the time of this assessment, Mr. Abboud indicated that he experienced increased difficulties  managing many self-care functions.   He now will not shower unless his wife is present.   He  experiences difficulty with managing dressing, particularly, zippers, socks and footwear. He no  longer partakes in any meal preparation and relies on his wife for the management of all  financial affairs.   He is often unable to open jars due to pain in his hands, noting increased  difficulty with bending his fingers and using his hands forcefully.  Please refer to the Attendant Care section of this report for more information.  Pre and Post Accident Home Management Activities:  Prior to the 2013 accident, Mr. Abboud was responsible for almost all indoor and outdoor  housekeeping and home maintenance activities. Mr. Abboud noted that he grew up in a large  family and was required to manage household chores with his siblings. In his marriage to his  wife Rania, Mr. Abboud has taken responsibility for all indoor housekeeping and outdoor home  maintenance tasks while she managed child care and dinner meal preparation.  At the time of the subject MVA of May 2019, Mr. Abboud had not resumed engagement in his  housekeeping and home maintenance responsibilities.   He indicated that his mother-in-law  would come to the home almost daily to bring food, help with housekeeping and interact with  the kids.  Following his 2019 MVA, Mr. Abboud noted that he is now completely dependent on his wife in  regards to the management of their household.   He no longer prepares food for the family  (which he would routinely do at his restaurant), and now relies on food prepared by his wife to  sustain himself during the day when he is not sleeping.  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 18 of 23\n\nDate of Report: 2024-01-03  Pre and Post Accident Caregiving Activities:  Mr. Abboud has experienced a gradual decrease in the quality and quantity of his interactions  with his children.   He noted that with his son especially, the relationship has been deeply  impacted by his physical and psychological struggles. He noted that he tends to keep to himself  much more than before and is often criticized by his son for his lack of engagement and inability  to provide. His wife Rania remains the primary caregiver at this time.  Pre and Post Accident Vocational Activities:  Prior to his accident, Mr. Abboud noted that he worked 10 – 12 hours per day from Monday to  Saturday and would also work 4 hours on Sundays. He managed all aspects of his Shawarma  restaurant including prep work, cooking, customer service, inventory and cleaning.  In March of 2020, Mr. Abboud was forced to close his restaurant, this was a highly distressing  experience for him. He noted that he took a part-time job with another Shawarma restaurant  where he would work a few hours each day in order to provide in some way to the family  finances. He noted that he would obtain food from the restaurant which he would bring home  regularly for his family.  Mr. Abboud provided notice to his current employer that he is unable to continue working and  provided a November 1, 2022 date to end his engagement in the workplace.   The physical  impact of his workplace attendance and the resultant effects on his mood cannot be overstated.  Mr. Abboud persisted to remain employed due to his strong desire to provide for his wife and  children, and the process of realizing that he can no longer continue has been emotionally  devastating.  Pre and Post Accident Leisure Activities:  Prior to his 2013 accident, Mr. Abboud reported that he engaged in a number of leisure  activities such as various sports (including soccer, swimming, running). He was also active with  his son, whom he would take to the park on a regular basis to play.  Following his 2013 accident, Mr. Abboud noted that he was no longer able to engage in any  form of leisure activity. He has no meaningful activity to occupy his time.  He remains in a state of functional decompensation where he spends the bulk of his time either  sitting or lying on the sofa, watching television or sleeping.   He no longer participates in any  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 19 of 23",

(10) Psychological Assessment Report completed by Dr Reesor dated March 24, 2020  PRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY:  Mr. Abboud reported being a historically very active man, working long hours in his Shawarma  restaurant. When not at work, he was actively involved in sports such as soccer, swimming and  running. He noted that he rarely got sick, and never took time off other than to go to Lebanon  for a trip every three years.   He was involved in his first MVA in 2013, when his vehicle was  rear-ended by a transport truck, resulting in the following injuries:  ●   Left knee meniscal injury and osteochondral injury  ●   Right knee meniscal injury with possible osteochondral injury  ●   Chronic myofascial strain to the neck (cervical spine)  ●   Chronic myofascial strain to the back (lumbar spine)  ●   Post- Traumatic Stress Disorder  ●   Major Depressive Disorder, Severe, with Anxious Distress  ●   Somatic Symptom Disorder  Mr. Abboud has experienced a difficult course of recovery from these injuries, which left him  with significant residual mobility issues impacting his overall function. Additionally, he has  experienced an array of psychological symptoms resulting in a deterioration of his mood. He  was continuing to recover from these injuries at the time of the subject MVA. He was required  to close his restaurant in March of 2020 as he was no longer able to operate his business. He  made some efforts to continue working part-time hours with another shawarma restaurant  owned by a friend but was required to stop working in November of 2022.  MECHANISM OF INJURY:  Mr. Abboud stated that he was the only occupant wearing a seat belt in his vehicle during a  collision on the evening of May 29, 2019, while on his way to work. At the time of the collision,  he was stationary at a red light near Hunt Club and Tim Hortons at Bowesville/Paul Benoit  Driveway. He was rear-ended by another vehicle. The impact caused his head and neck to be  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  Fawzi Abboud   Claim #: 34555770   Page 6 of 23",
