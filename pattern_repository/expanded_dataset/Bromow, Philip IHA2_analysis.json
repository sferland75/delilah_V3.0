PURPOSE OF REFERRAL :  At   the   request   of   McNally   Gervan   Law   Firm,   this   therapist   completed   a   re-assessment   of   Mr.  Bromow's   level   of   func \u0000 on   as   it   relates   to   the   injuries   he   sustained   in   the   subject   MVA   of   July  23,   2021.   This   assessment   included   a   request   for   a   reassessment   of   the   a \u0000 endant   care   needs  given   the   func \u0000 onal   deteriora \u0000 on   which   has   taken   place   since   this   therapist’s   last   assessment.  An   OCF18   was   submi \u0000 ed   to   the   insurer   for   the   cost   of   this   assessment,   however,   this   was  declined.  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:  On   July   23,   2021,   Mr.   Bromow,   now   aged   60,   was   involved   in   a   motor   vehicle   accident.   His  bicycle   was   hit   by   a   vehicle,   leading   to   his   entrapment   underneath   it.   Bystanders   extricated   him,  and   he   was   transported   to   the   O \u0000 awa   Civic   Hospital   by   ambulance.   Despite   being   o ff ered   an  overnight   stay,   he   elected   to   return   home   due   to   the   COVID   pandemic,   wan \u0000 ng   to   avoid  occupying   a   hospital   bed   unnecessarily.   A \u0000 er   receiving   s \u0000 tches,   undergoing   a   CT   scan,   and  signing   a   self-release   form,   he   returned   home   by   taxi.   He   was   given   a   follow-up   appointment   for  s \u0000 tch removal and men \u0000 oned di ffi culty breathing through his right nostril.  Before   this   incident,   Mr.   Bromow   had   dental   problems   and   chronic   lower   back   pain,   a \u0000 ributed  to   his   career   in   physical   labor   as   a   \u0000 ler.   Since   2009,   his   back   pain,   rated   5-6/10   in   intensity,  interfered   with   his   sleep   and   daily   ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es.   Despite   these   di ffi cul \u0000 es,   he   con \u0000 nued   working  un \u0000 l   becoming   a   recipient   of   ODSP   in   2016   due   to   his   back   condi \u0000 on,   characterized   by  diminished   disc   space   in   the   L2-L4   region.   He   con \u0000 nued   to   work   part- \u0000 me,   under   the   table,  performing   easier   \u0000 ling   tasks   such   as   backsplashes,   which   a ff orded   him   extra   funds   to   pay   for  his   extraordinary   expenses.   In   his   life \u0000 me,   Mr.   Bromow   experienced   around   twenty   motorcycle  accidents, resul \u0000 ng in minor injuries but no major trauma.  The   injuries   sustained   in   the   recent   accident   include   a   concussion,   facial   lacera \u0000 ons   requiring  s \u0000 tches,   neck   so \u0000   \u0000 ssue   injuries,   cuts   on   both   shoulders,   spinal   so \u0000   \u0000 ssue   injury,   and   right   knee  pain.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Philip Bromow   Claim #: 000-01-611167   Page   2   of   20\n\nDate of Report: 2023-12-19  Over   the   past   year,   Mr.   Bromow   has   experienced   a   steady   deteriora \u0000 on   of   his   physical   and  mental   health.   He   has   developed   a   chronic   degree   of   malnutri \u0000 on   which   has   led   to   a   20%   loss  of   body   mass,   largely   through   muscle   atrophy.   At   the   \u0000 me   of   this   assessment,   Mr.   Bromow  shared   his   deep   concerns   for   his   medical   wellbeing,   no \u0000 ng   that   he   worries   he   “will   not   make   it  through   another   year”.   He   has   obtained   meal   replacement   drinks   through   his   brother   however  this   supply   is   inconsistent   and   not   su ffi cient   to   meet   his   caloric   needs.   He   is   no   longer  maintaining   his   room   environment   and   has   been   required   to   resort   to   stealing   clothing   items  from   a   local   used   clothing   store   in   order   to   eliminate   the   need   to   launder   his   clothing.   He   notes  that   he   experiences   a   high   degree   of   shame   at   this   development   but   notes   that   he   sees   no  other op \u0000 on.  At   the   \u0000 me   of   this   assessment,   Mr.   Bromow   presents   with   A \u0000 endant   Care   Needs   for   the  management   of   his   meals   and   upkeep   of   his   bedroom   environment.   He   also   requires   assistance  with Extra Laundering to o ff set the di ffi cul \u0000 es he experiences in comple \u0000 ng laundry.  RECOMMENDATIONS:  A \u0000 endant Care:  Mr.   Bromow   is   found   to   require   a \u0000 endant   care   to   assist   with   the   management   of   meal  prepara \u0000 on,   as   well   as   for   the   maintenance   of   his   home   environment.   He   would   currently  bene fi t   from   9.75   hours   per   week   of   a \u0000 endant   care   to   assist   with   meal   prepara \u0000 on   and   extra  laundering.   Mr.   Bromow   is   currently   in   need   of   a \u0000 endant   care   as   a   result   of   a   combina \u0000 on   of  physical,   emo \u0000 onal,   and   cogni \u0000 ve   symptoms.   Please   refer   to   the   enclosed   Form   1   for   more  details.  Housekeeping:  Mr. Bromow would bene fi t from 2 hours per week of housekeeping assistance to assist with the  management of his boarding room environment which has been le \u0000   unkempt since the subject  MVA. He is currently requiring this assistance as a result of ongoing pain and poor mental  health.  Assis \u0000 ve Devices:  Mr. Bromow is in need of a replacement ma \u0000 ress as he has no proper surface to lie on in his  bedroom environment. An OCF18 for a replacement bed system will be submi \u0000 ed in the New  Year.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Philip Bromow   Claim #: 000-01-611167   Page   3   of   20\n\nDate of Report: 2023-12-19  Further Occupa \u0000 onal Therapy Interven \u0000 ons:  As   Mr.   Bromow   navigates   his   precarious   medical   situa \u0000 on,   he   would   bene fi t   from   access   to   OT  and RA services to foster engagement in meaningful ac \u0000 vity, and provide support as required.

At   the   \u0000 me   of  this   assessment,   Mr.   Bromow   remains   without   a   family   physician,   and   he   has   consequently  sought   recent   medical   advice   through   a   virtual   service   (Lyte   Medical),   where   he   has   undergone  a   preliminary   consulta \u0000 on   with   a   family   physician.

DOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:  There was no documenta \u0000 on available for review at the   \u0000 me of this assessment.  PRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY:  Prior   to   the   subject   motor   vehicle   accident,   Mr.   Bromow   reported   some   dental   issues   and   had   a  history   of   lower   back   pain.   Over   his   years   working   in   physical   labour   as   a   \u0000 ler,   Mr.   Bromow  reported   having   developed   a   loss   of   disc   space   in   his   lower   back   at   the   L2   to   L4   levels.   As   a  result   of   his   lower   back   pain,   Mr.   Bromow   has   been   an   ODSP   recipient   since   2016.   From   age   16  onwards, Mr. Bromow worked as a self-employed   \u0000 ler.  Prior   to   the   subject   motor   vehicle   accident,   Mr.   Bromow   reported   lower   back   pain   levels   of   5   –  6/10   which   was   constant   in   nature.   He   reported   that   his   pain   “took   away   from   my   sleeping”.  He   began   experiencing   lower   back   issues   in   2009   to   2011,   and   gradually,   he   began   experiencing  di ffi culty   ge \u0000 ng   up   in   the   morning   and   struggles   with   li \u0000 ing   substan \u0000 al   loads.   He   worked  through the pain and would rest when he was not working.  Mr.   Bromow   has   experienced   approximately   twenty   motorcycle   crashes   over   his   life \u0000 me  without any major trauma. He reported minor injuries to his knees, elbows and wrists.  Otherwise,   Mr.   Bromow   was   in   good   general   physical   health.   He   acknowledged   drinking   alcohol  on   a   regular   basis.   He   reportedly   drank   beer   daily,   but   denied   drinking   hard   liquor,   and   avoided  street   drugs   with   the   excep \u0000 on   of   the   periodic   use   of   small   amounts   of   cannabis.   Mr.   Bromow  denies   any   other   physical   or   psychological   issues   which   may   impact   his   course   of   recovery   or   his  clinical presenta \u0000 on at the   \u0000 me of this assessment.  MECHANISM OF INJURY:  On   the   date   of   loss,   Mr.   Bromow   reported   that   he   was   riding   the   train   in   O \u0000 awa   and   got   o ff   with  plans   to   ride   his   bike   downtown   that   day.   He   was   riding   towards   the   downtown   core   when   he  was   struck   by   a   vehicle,   being   thrown   to   the   ground.   His   fi rst   recollec \u0000 on   post-impact   was   lying  on   the   ground   staring   at   the   oil   pan   on   the   underside   of   a   vehicle.   He   asked   the   driver   at   the  \u0000 me   to   put   his   car   in   park   and   to   get   out   of   the   vehicle   to   relieve   pressure   on   his   body.  ______________________________________________________________________________  Philip Bromow   Claim #: 000-01-611167   Page   5   of   20\n\nDate of Report: 2023-12-19  Bystanders   a \u0000 ended   the   scene   of   the   accident   and   picked   up   the   car   and   pulled   him   out.   He  heard   the   sirens   approaching   and   was   taken   by   ambulance   to   the   O \u0000 awa   Civic   Hospital.   He   was  asked   to   stay   overnight   but   he   chose   to   go   home   as   a   result   of   the   COVID   pandemic   (not  wan \u0000 ng   to   hold   a   bed   unnecessarily).   He   was   “s \u0000 tched   up”,   had   a   CT   scan   and   was   released  home.   He   called   a   taxi   a \u0000 er   signing   a   self-release   form   and   went   home   to   rest.   He   was   provided  with   a   follow-up   appointment   to   have   his   s \u0000 tches   removed   and   he   reported   issues   with   his   nose  as he could not breathe out of his right nostril.  NATURE OF INJURY:  As a result of the subject MVA, Mr. Bromow reportedly sustained the following injuries:  ●   Concussion  ●   Facial lacera \u0000 ons requiring s \u0000 tches  ●   Neck so \u0000   \u0000 ssue injuries  ●   Cuts to both shoulders  ●   So \u0000   \u0000 ssue injury to spine  ●   Right knee pain  COURSE OF RECOVERY TO DATE:  Since   the   date   of   the   accident,   Mr.   Bromow   has   not   received   much   in   the   form   of   physical   or  psychological   care.   A \u0000 empts   were   made   to   connect   Mr.   Bromow   with   Health   Care   Connect,   in  order   to   secure   a   family   physician.   However,   this   has   not   proven   frui \u0000 ul   as   he   remains   without   a  dedicated   GP   to   manage   his   care.   He   has   been   directed   to   a   virtual   service,   Lyte   Medical,   where  he   has   undergone   one   virtual   assessment   with   a   GP.   Mr.   Bromow   is   reportedly   expec \u0000 ng   a  number   of   requisi \u0000 ons   for   various   tests   through   the   mail,   and   has   yet   to   receive   this   package.  He   was   unable   to   establish   the   speci fi c   tes \u0000 ng   requested   by   the   physician,   commen \u0000 ng   “I   asked  him   to   check   everything,   give   me   a   full   workup.”   This   process   is   being   monitored   by   his   social  worker, Jaden Bailey, who remains in regular contact with Mr. Bromow.  He   indicated   that   he   has   received   no   addi \u0000 onal   form   of   treatment,   and   has   been   steadily  declining   both   from   a   physical   and   mental   health   perspec \u0000 ve.

He   has   access   to   a   kitchen   which   he   shares   with   ten   other  tenants   and   is   responsible   for   the   upkeep   of   this   environment   a \u0000 er   use.   His   building   does   not  have   an   elevator   and   he   is   required   to   climb   3   fl ights   of   stairs   to   access   his   room.   The   bathroom  and   kitchen   are   both   located   on   his   fl oor.   He   reported   that   he   must   transport   personal   care  items   to   the   bathroom   each   \u0000 me   he   is   to   use   it,   and   concurrently,   is   also   responsible   for   taking  cooking tools and ingredients to the kitchen on a plas \u0000 c tray in order to prepare his daily meals.

He   indicated   that   he   would   engage   in   daily   grooming,   would   prepare  meals   (at   \u0000 mes   more   elaborate   ones   such   as   a   spaghe \u0000   sauce)   and   keep   as   ac \u0000 ve   as   he   could  despite his physical limita \u0000 ons.  At   the   \u0000 me   of   this   assessment,   Mr.   Bromow   indicated   that   he   struggles   with   the   management  of   ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es   such   as   meal   prepara \u0000 on,   laundry   and   cleaning   of   his   room   environment.   He   has  experienced   di ffi cul \u0000 es   with   comple \u0000 ng   meals   as   he   is   no   longer   feeling   able   to   complete   the  chore   of   carrying   his   cookware   and   ingredients   to   the   kitchen,   which   he   noted   must   be   cleaned  before   he   starts   cooking   as   a   result   of   other   tenants   not   cleaning   a \u0000 er   themselves.   The  complica \u0000 ons   inherent   to   cooking   in   this   environment   have   developed   into   a   barrier   to  adequate caloric intake which has translated into signi fi cant weight loss.  Mr.   Bromow   noted   that   he   struggles   with   managing   his   laundry   and   has   resorted   to   the \u0000   of  used   clothing   items   from   a   local   store   where   he   will   acquire   fresh   clothing   to   replace   the   dirty  ones   he   is   unable   to   launder.   This   has   contributed   to   a   deteriora \u0000 on   of   his   mood,   as   he   feels  shame   over   how   he   has   coped   with   his   di ffi cul \u0000 es.   Compounding   these   issues   are   his   poor  sleep,   resultant   from   pain   and   a   poor   sleeping   surface.   Mr.   Bromow   noted   that   he   experienced  a   bed   bug   infesta \u0000 on   in   the   last   year,   leading   to   a   removal   of   his   ma \u0000 ress   and   introduc \u0000 on   of   an  in fl atable   air   ma \u0000 ress.

This   is   necessary   to   address   his   chronic   malnutri \u0000 on   and   the   ongoing   issues  with   household   management.

Mr.   Bromow   indicated   that   he   managed   all   of   these  ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es without di ffi culty and that “my room was always clean and   \u0000 dy”.  At   the   \u0000 me   of   this   assessment,   Mr.   Bromow   has   experienced   a   deteriora \u0000 on   of   his   living   space  due   to   an   inability   to   clean   (due   to   pain   and   depressed   mood)   and   associated   issues   with   being  unable   to   manage   his   laundry   and   acquiring   replacement   clothing   instead   of   washing   his  clothes.   This   has   contributed   to   the   clu \u0000 er   in   his   environment   as   he   accumulates   dirty   clothing  items.  Pre and Post Accident Voca \u0000 onal Ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es:  Prior   to   the   subject   MVA,   Mr.   Bromow   indicated   that   he   was   an   ODSP   recipient   as   a   result   of   a  disability   precluding   him   from   comple \u0000 ng   \u0000 ling   work.   He   con \u0000 nued   to   complete   small   side   jobs  for 4 hours per day, comple \u0000 ng tasks such as kitchen backsplashes “or other easy jobs”.  At   the   \u0000 me   of   this   assessment,   Mr.   Bromow   indicated   that   he   is   no   longer   able   to   complete   his  part- \u0000 me   \u0000 ling   work   due   to   an   escala \u0000 on   of   his   poor   mood   and   deteriora \u0000 on   of   his   physical  condi \u0000 oning.   He   notes   that   this   has   resulted   in   a   loss   of   supplementary   income   fueling   his   need  to engage in low-level the \u0000   of used clothing and food items.  Pre and Post Accident Leisure Ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es:  Prior   to   the   subject   MVA,   Mr.   Bromow   indicated   that   he   enjoyed   playing   outdoors   with   friends,  engaging in the following ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es:  ●   Playing frisbee  ●   Playing catch  ●   Hi \u0000 ng golf balls in a   fi eld  ●   Cycling   (he   would   cycle   as   his   primary   mode   of   transporta \u0000 on   in   associa \u0000 on   with   bus  riding).  ______________________________________________________________________________  Philip Bromow   Claim #: 000-01-611167   Page   15   of   20\n\nDate of Report: 2023-12-19  At   the   \u0000 me   of   this   assessment,   Mr.   Bromow   indicated   that   he   no   longer   engages   in   any   of   his  pre-accident   leisure   ac \u0000 vi \u0000 es.   He   stopped   riding   his   bicycle   to   access   the   community   due   to   the  change   in   weather,   and   as   a   result,   he’s   been   walking   more   than   he   had   been   over   the   warmer  months.   He   notes   that   this   increase   in   walking   demands   has   resulted   in   \u0000 ngling   and   numbness  in   his   feet,   impac \u0000 ng   his   ability   to   walk   longer   distances.   He   avoids   community   ou \u0000 ngs   as   much  as   possible,   spending   much   of   his   \u0000 me   in   his   room   watching   television.   He   has   no   meaningful  ac \u0000 vity   to   occupy   his   \u0000 me   and   this   has   further   contributed   to   a   deteriora \u0000 on   of   his   mental  health.
