ASSESSMENT PREAMBLE:  This   in-home   assessment   was   conducted   to   evaluate   Ms.   Veronique   Slykhuis's   current functional abilities and limitations following injuries sustained in a motor vehicle collision on August 26, 2023. The assessment was requested by her legal representative, Mr. Paul Mooney of Badre Law Professional Corporation, to:  ●   Complete an updated in-home assessment addressing current functional status  ●   Evaluate ongoing attendant care needs  ●   Provide   recommendations   regarding   additional   occupational   therapy   services   and equipment needs  ●   Identify other services that may assist in recovery  ●   Provide commentary on Catastrophic Impairment spheres of function (AMA Guides 2014)  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:  Ms. Slykhuis is a 50-year-old woman who sustained serious injuries in a motor vehicle collision on August 26, 2023, when she was a belted passenger in a vehicle struck at high speed on the passenger side. The impact caused the vehicle to spin and land in a ditch, with her 17-year-old son arriving at the scene. The collision resulted in significant physical trauma including left breast hematomas requiring surgical aspiration, a displaced left rib fracture, and an undisplaced mid-sternal fracture, with a reported left breast tear pending confirmation.  Fifteen months post-accident, Ms. Slykhuis continues to present with a complex constellation of physical,   cognitive,   and   psycho-emotional   symptoms   that   profoundly   impact   her   daily functioning. Her physical symptoms are dominated by severe chest pain and pressure (rated  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 2 of 25\n\n6-10/10) characterized by burning sensations and a pulling sensation extending from shoulder to shoulder. She experiences radiating pain from her lower back to her leg during ambulation, requiring the use of a single-point cane for stability. Her mobility is significantly compromised by balance impairments necessitating the use of supports during transfers, and she demonstrates a notably guarded gait pattern with reduced arm swing on the left side. Additional physical symptoms include left-sided headaches (6-8/10), cervical pain radiating to the left shoulder (4-8/10), left hand paresthesia, and persistent left ear tinnitus (8/10).  Cognitively, Ms. Slykhuis demonstrates significant impairments across multiple domains. Most notably, she exhibits pronounced executive dysfunction, evidenced by impaired judgment and impulse control in financial management. This is exemplified by recent episodes of compulsive online   shopping   and   gambling, resulting in substantial financial losses, and questionable purchasing decisions such as buying excessive quantities of unused items. Her memory deficits affect both recent event recall and prospective memory, impacting her ability to manage appointments and medications despite using organizational aids. She demonstrates marked difficulties with attention, concentration, and processing speed, becoming easily overwhelmed by multiple stimuli and requiring extended time to comprehend and respond to questions.  From a psycho-emotional perspective, Ms. Slykhuis presents with severe anxiety, particularly related to vehicular transportation, resulting in significant avoidance behaviors. She has not attempted to drive since the accident and becomes notably distressed when passing near the accident location. While she had a pre-existing history of depression that was well-managed pre-accident, her symptoms have intensified considerably, manifesting as frequent tearfulness, social withdrawal, and loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities. She exhibits pronounced post-traumatic   stress   symptoms   including   intrusive   thoughts,   flashbacks,   and   frequent nightmares that disrupt her sleep. Her emotional distress is compounded by significant sleep disruption, with multiple nighttime awakenings due to both pain and anxiety.  Prior to the accident, Ms. Slykhuis maintained full-time employment as a Customer Support Coordinator with the Standards Council of Canada (remote position) and part-time employment as a cashier at Independent Grocer, demonstrating her capacity to manage complex cognitive tasks and physical demands. She has been unable to return to either position due to her ongoing symptoms and functional limitations. The loss of employment has created additional financial   strain and emotional distress, particularly impacting her ability to maintain her previous standard of living and social engagement.  The cumulative impact of these impairments has resulted in a significant deterioration in Ms. Slykhuis's quality of life and independence. Her daily routine has become severely restricted, characterized by limited activity tolerance, frequent rest periods, and dependency on others for many basic activities of daily living. The interaction between her physical limitations, cognitive deficits, and emotional distress has created a self-perpetuating cycle that continues to impede her recovery and reintegration into her pre-accident roles and activities.  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 3 of 25\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS:  1.   Attendant Care based on the Form 1 assessment completed as part of this evaluation, Ms. Slykhuis continues to require attendant care services totaling   $2,352.90   per month.

DOCUMENTATION REVIEWED:  A complete list of documents reviewed is available upon request.   The following documents were specifically referenced in the completion of this assessment:  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 5 of 25\n\n●   Occupational Therapy Initial Assessment Report by Stephanie Bosse, dated October 12, 2023  ●   Progress Report by Kaylee Kozera OT, dated January 9, 2024  ●   Psychological Assessment Report by Dr. Jeremy Frank, dated November 13, 2023  ●   Clinical notes from Dr. Sophie Gauthier (Family Physician)  ●   Sleep Medicine consultation note from Dr. Alan Lowe dated October 17, 2023  ●   Various hospital and clinical records from August-December 2023  PRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY:  Prior to the subject accident, Ms. Slykhuis had a history of:  ●   Depression managed with medication and psychiatric follow-up  ●   Deep Vein Thrombosis (2019) and Pulmonary Embolism (2020) requiring blood thinners  ●   Sleep disturbance requiring medication  ●   Left frozen shoulder (2021)  ●   Sleep apnea diagnosed January 2023  Despite these conditions, Ms. Slykhuis was able to maintain full-time and part-time employment, manage her home independently, and engage actively in social activities. Her pre-existing conditions were well-managed and did not significantly impact her daily functioning at the time of the accident.  MECHANISM OF INJURY:  On August 26, 2023, Ms. Slykhuis was a belted passenger in a vehicle that was struck at high speed by another vehicle. The impact occurred on the passenger side, causing their vehicle to spin   before landing in a ditch. Ms. Slykhuis has limited recall of the incident itself but remembers gripping tightly to the left side with both hands, opening her eyes to find herself in the ditch, and experiencing severe chest pain. Her 17-year-old son attended the scene. She was assessed by emergency services and transported to Cornwall Community Hospital.  NATURE OF INJURY:  Based on medical documentation reviewed and client report, Ms. Slykhuis sustained the following injuries as a result of the subject motor vehicle accident:  ●   Left breast traumatic injury with multifocal hematomas requiring surgical aspiration  ●   Displaced left rib fracture  ●   Undisplaced mid-sternal fracture  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 6 of 25\n\nCOURSE OF RECOVERY TO DATE:  Following initial assessment at Cornwall Community Hospital, Ms. Slykhuis was discharged home with pain medication. Due to ongoing severe symptoms, she returned to hospital on September 1, 2023, where imaging revealed the extent of her injuries. She underwent surgical consultation and subsequent breast aspiration on September 13, 2023. The smaller hematomas could not be aspirated and were expected to take 6-8 months to resolve.  Her recovery has been complicated by:  ●   Severe ongoing pain limiting mobility and function  ●   Development of significant anxiety and post-traumatic stress symptoms  ●   Cognitive changes affecting memory and executive function  ●   Sleep disruption due to pain and nightmares  ●   Social isolation and withdrawal  ●   Inability to return to work  Ms. Slykhuis has received the following treatments:  ●   Personal Support Worker services for assistance with daily activities  ●   Occupational Therapy assessment and treatment  ●   Psychological assessment  ●   Follow-up with psychiatrist Dr. Ahmed for management of mental health symptoms  ●   Family physician monitoring  ●   Sleep medicine consultation  Despite these interventions, Ms. Slykhuis continues to experience significant functional limitations and has not returned to her pre-accident level of function.

Has difficulty reading  written material.  NA  Cognitive Symptoms:  Ms. Slykhuis reports significant changes in her cognitive functioning since the accident. Her memory has been notably affected - she struggles to recall details of the accident itself and subsequent medical appointments, frequently forgets daily tasks and conversations, and has difficulty maintaining her medication schedule despite using bubble packs. She describes needing to write things down immediately to avoid forgetting important information.  Her attention and concentration have been significantly impacted. She finds herself easily overwhelmed by multiple stimuli and has difficulty maintaining focus during conversations or while watching television. These difficulties are particularly pronounced when her pain levels are elevated. She notes that her processing speed has slowed considerably - she requires more time to understand and respond to questions, complete familiar tasks, and process written information.  Ms. Slykhuis describes substantial challenges with executive functioning, manifesting as difficulties planning and organizing daily activities, managing appointments, making decisions, and solving even simple household problems. She notes that tasks requiring multiple steps have become particularly challenging and she often struggles to initiate activities independently.  Her communication abilities have also been affected. She frequently experiences word-finding difficulties and struggles to express her thoughts clearly. She reports sometimes losing track during conversations and having difficulty following complex instructions.  Emotional Symptoms:  Ms. Slykhuis reports experiencing significant emotional changes since the accident that have profoundly impacted her daily life and relationships. She describes persistent anxiety, particularly related to vehicles and transportation. When being driven by others, she often closes her eyes and becomes hypervigilant about potential accident scenarios. She has not attempted to drive since the accident and becomes notably distressed when passing near the accident location. This vehicle-related anxiety has led to significant avoidance behaviors - she  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 9 of 25\n\nrarely leaves her house except for medical appointments, which has contributed to increasing social isolation.  Her mood has deteriorated significantly since the accident. While she had a pre-existing history of depression that was well-managed before the collision, she reports her symptoms have intensified considerably. She experiences frequent tearfulness, particularly when discussing the impact of the accident on her life and work abilities. She describes a loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities and has withdrawn from most social interactions. Ms. Slykhuis reports spending most of her time at home alone, having difficulty initiating even basic activities like watching television or responding to phone messages from friends.  Of particular concern are her post-traumatic stress symptoms. She experiences frequent nightmares about the accident that disrupt her sleep. These nightmares often cause her to wake in a state of panic, after which she has difficulty returning to sleep. She reports intrusive thoughts about the accident throughout the day and finds herself reliving aspects of the event. This has led to what she describes as persistent anxiety about bedtime, knowing these disturbing dreams are likely to occur.  The impact on her social relationships has been substantial. While she maintains phone contact with her sons, she notes they are busy with their own lives. She expresses particular distress about her reduced ability to fulfill her previous parenting role, especially regarding her 17-year-old son who recently moved away for post-secondary education. While she has a supportive circle of friends who offer assistance, she acknowledges a tendency to isolate herself and not respond to their attempts to connect.  Ms. Slykhuis expresses significant concern about her future, particularly regarding her ability to return to work. She worries about how her extended absence will be perceived by colleagues and fears she may never regain her previous level of function. She describes feeling \"trapped\" in her current situation, wanting to improve but feeling overwhelmed by her physical symptoms and emotional responses.  Symptom Management Strategies:  Ms. Slykhuis reports attempting to manage her symptoms through:  ●   Regular rest periods throughout the day  ●   Use of prescribed medications for pain and mood  ●   Prescribed sleeping medications  ●   Limited walking with her dog when able  ●   Support from personal support worker for daily activities  ●   Avoiding anxiety-provoking situations  ●   Use of positioning and supports for physical comfort  ●   Writing notes to compensate for memory difficulties  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 10 of 25\n\nFUNCTIONAL AND BEHAVIOURAL OBSERVATIONS:  During the assessment, Ms. Slykhuis presented as a well-groomed woman who appeared her stated age. She was oriented to person, place, and time, though she demonstrated some difficulty recalling specific dates and details of recent events. She engaged appropriately in the assessment process but required frequent breaks due to pain and fatigue. Her affect was generally flat, with periods of tearfulness when discussing the impact of the accident on her life. Her speech was clear but showed occasional word-finding difficulties and slowed processing speed.  Tolerances, Mobility and Transfers:  Ms. Slykhuis demonstrated significant limitations in her physical functioning during the assessment. When sitting, she could tolerate approximately 20-25 minutes before needing to change positions due to increasing pain. She was observed frequently shifting between positions and supporting her left chest area with her arm or a pillow. Even during these brief sitting periods, she displayed visible signs of discomfort including grimacing and guarding behaviors.  Bed mobility was observed to be significantly compromised. Ms. Slykhuis required multiple steps to transition from lying to sitting, frequently pausing due to pain. She demonstrated a consistent need to support her chest area during these movements and showed increased difficulty with movements to her left side.  Transfers were completed independently but with notable difficulty. When moving from sitting to standing, Ms. Slykhuis was observed to brace herself using nearby furniture and demonstrated a multi-step process that included pausing mid-transfer to manage pain. She required standby assistance during bathroom transfers and showed increased difficulty with lower surface heights such as the toilet. While she maintained independence with shower transfers, she demonstrated significant guarding behaviors and relied heavily on grab bars for support.  Walking was observed to be slow and deliberate, with Ms. Slykhuis adopting a guarded posture that favored her left side. She used a single-point cane for stability during ambulation and was observed to reach for walls or furniture when walking without the cane. Her walking endurance was limited to approximately 200 meters, after which she reported significant increases in pain and required rest. Her gait pattern showed evidence of compensation, with reduced arm swing on the left side and shortened step length.  Balance testing revealed impairments in both static and dynamic balance. Ms. Slykhuis demonstrated increased sway during quiet standing and required upper extremity support  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 11 of 25\n\nduring any reaching or bending activities. She was unable to perform tandem stance or single-leg stance due to instability and fear of falling. These balance impairments significantly impact her safety with daily activities and increase her risk for falls.  Active Range of Motion:  Range of motion testing revealed significant limitations, particularly in the trunk and upper body. Ms. Slykhuis demonstrated reduced cervical range of motion in all planes, with pain limiting end-range movements. Shoulder range of motion was notably restricted on the left side, with pain reported throughout the available range. Trunk mobility was severely limited, with Ms. Slykhuis unable to bend forward beyond approximately 30 degrees due to pain. She demonstrated compensatory movements when reaching or bending, often shifting her entire body rather than moving through her trunk.  Emotional Presentation:  Ms. Slykhuis's emotional presentation during the assessment was characterized by frequent shifts in affect. While she attempted to engage appropriately in the assessment process, she became tearful when discussing the impact of her injuries on her independence and ability to work. She appeared anxious when discussing transportation needs and future medical appointments. Her mood appeared to deteriorate as the assessment progressed and her pain and fatigue increased.  Cognitive Presentation:  Throughout the assessment, Ms. Slykhuis exhibited significant cognitive impairments that affected her participation and performance. Her information processing speed was markedly diminished, requiring extended time for question comprehension and response formulation. Her responses frequently digressed from the original topic, necessitating gentle redirection to maintain focus on assessment components. The increased cognitive demand of the assessment process appeared to compound her fatigue symptoms.  Of particular significance was a pattern of executive dysfunction that emerged during the recent holiday season. Ms. Slykhuis demonstrated poor judgment and impulsive behavior in her approach to holiday gift purchasing, acquiring numerous items without clear purpose or planning. This resulted in the accumulation of unopened packages and required significant therapeutic intervention to develop and implement an organized approach to gift distribution. Despite her pre-accident history of generous gift-giving, her current inability to independently modify this behavior or develop alternative strategies suggests a decline in problem-solving abilities and cognitive flexibility.  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 12 of 25\n\nMemory deficits were consistently observed throughout the assessment. Ms. Slykhuis relied heavily on written notes for basic information such as appointment dates and medication details. She demonstrated difficulty with temporal sequencing of recent events and showed inconsistent recall of medical appointments. Her attempts at independent problem-solving were often ineffective, requiring structured guidance to develop and implement practical solutions.  The assessment process revealed notable challenges with sustained attention and task persistence. These difficulties manifested in her need for frequent redirection and tendency to lose track of conversations, particularly as fatigue increased throughout the session. This presentation is consistent with her reported difficulties in managing daily activities and suggests a significant change from her pre-accident level of cognitive functioning.  A number of concerning behaviours demonstrating impulsivity, lack of judgement and lack of self-awareness we observed and documented later in this report under the financial management section.  TYPICAL DAY:  Based on Ms. Slykhuis's report during the assessment, her current daily routine consists of the following:  Morning Routine: She typically wakes between 7:00-8:30 AM, often after a disrupted night's sleep due to pain and nightmares. She takes her dog for a brief morning walk, though she reports this is challenging due to pain and requires frequent stops. After returning home, she reports needing to lie down to recover from this activity.  She will make a simple breakfast shake or coffee and move to her living room sofa. She attempts to check emails but reports this is often challenging due to concentration difficulties and physical discomfort when sitting at her computer. She requires frequent position changes and often needs to lie down after 20-30 minutes of sitting upright.  Afternoon Activities: Around noon, she takes her dog out again, typically sitting outside while throwing a frisbee rather than walking due to increased pain and fatigue. She relies on reheating prepared foods for lunch as she reports difficulty with meal preparation tasks.  She typically needs to rest in bed around 1:00 PM, describing this as the time when her symptoms are most severe (\"c'est la que ca frappe\" –   “that’s when it hits me” ). After resting, she attempts some light housekeeping tasks such as loading/unloading the dishwasher or light tidying, but reports these activities often increase her pain significantly.  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 13 of 25\n\nEvening Routine: Ms. Slykhuis reports having difficulty with meal preparation and often relies on takeout or reheated meals. She attempts another short walk with her dog in the evening, typically combining this with seated frisbee play to manage her symptoms.  She reports going to bed around 7:00 PM, though she has difficulty falling asleep due to pain and anxiety. She listens to podcasts but reports being unable to follow the content. She takes her evening medications and attempts to sleep around 8:30-9:00 PM. She reports waking 3-4 times per night due to pain and nightmares, requiring repositioning and occasionally getting up for water. She notes feeling unsteady during these nighttime awakenings.  Social/Leisure Activities: Ms. Slykhuis reports that her social and leisure activities have been significantly curtailed since the accident. While she previously enjoyed frequent social outings and travel to the United States, she now rarely leaves her home except for medical appointments. Her primary social interaction is through phone conversations with family members and occasional visits from friends who assist with errands or grocery shopping.

The loss of her daily Personal Support Worker (PSW) disrupted the flow she was accustomed to, making it difficult to find a suitable replacement. Washing her hair was an ordeal she could only manage with the assistance of her PSW, as standing in the shower often left her feeling extremely dizzy. To alleviate this, her PSW would keep the shower door open, providing a sense of security and immediate aid if needed.  When showering without assistance, she would do so sitting down to prevent falls. Sometimes, she would remain in the same clothing for three to four days, and it was not unusual for her to keep her daytime bra on for extended periods.

Finances/Financial Management:  Ms. Slykhuis experiences significant challenges with financial management due to cognitive changes affecting her memory and organizational abilities. She reports having most bills on pre-authorized payments due to concerns about forgetting to pay them on time. She has not completed her 2023 income taxes and expresses significant worry about managing financial matters.  More concerning has been a pattern which emerged through the provision of several OT treatment sessions following this In-Home Assessment.   Ms. Slykhuis has reported having developed online shopping and gambling issues which have led to the loss of several thousands of   dollars   in   recent   weeks.   She noted that she would justify these expenditures as a replacement for her previously enjoyed Casino excursions.   Following extensive discussion on the matter, she came to the realisation that this attempt to replace her casino outings with online gambling and shopping was deeply flawed.   She acknowledged that her enjoyment drawn from the casino excursions was more related to the event (getting dressed, going for dinner, going to the Casino with $40 limit, socializing and enjoying the environment, etc.).  Concurrently, Ms. Slykhuis has engaged in several questionable and concerning purchases, both at the local grocery store and online.   For example, she purchased an inordinately and uncharacteristically large quantity of frying oil and soda (several hundred dollars worth).   She noted that she does not use a deep fryer, nor does she drink soda, reflecting that her impulsive purchase at the time was motivated by a desire to obtain points on her grocery card. She later noticed that she had made a serious error and proceeded to donate the purchased items.  Caregiving Activities:  Ms. Slykhuis noted that her 17 year-old son has recently moved out for College and she no longer has any children in the home.  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 18 of 25\n\nVocational Activities:  Pre-accident Employment Status   Current Status  Full-time   position:   Customer   Support  Coordinator at Standards Council of Canada  (7 AM - 3:50 PM)  Not working since accident  Part-time position: Cashier at Independent  Grocer   (Two   evening   shifts   4-9   PM   and  5-9:15 PM, plus Saturdays 8 AM-4:30 PM)  Not working since accident  Pre-accident, Ms. Slykhuis maintained both positions successfully, managing remote work for her full-time position with occasional in-person requirements at the Ottawa office. Her part-time cashier position involved significant physical demands including standing, reaching, and lifting, which she managed without difficulty. She reports receiving frequent compliments on her performance, particularly regarding customer service.  Currently, Ms. Slykhuis is unable to return to either position due to:  ●   Physical limitations affecting her ability to sit for extended periods  ●   Pain with reaching and lifting movements  ●   Cognitive changes affecting concentration and multi-tasking abilities  ●   Inability to drive  ●   Emotional symptoms affecting her ability to interact with others  ●   Fatigue requiring frequent rest periods  Leisure Activities:  Prior to the accident, Ms. Slykhuis maintained an active and vibrant social life, regularly engaging in various recreational pursuits. She participated in frequent social outings with friends, typically three to four times per week, and enjoyed regular shopping and entertainment trips to the United States. Her daily routine included walks with her dog, and she particularly enjoyed dancing with her pet at home, demonstrating a playful and energetic disposition. She established weekly breakfast routines at local restaurants, maintaining strong social connections in her community. At the time of the accident, she had been looking forward to a planned vacation to Cuba with a friend.  Her current leisure engagement has diminished significantly since the accident. While she attempts to maintain some physical activity through walks with her dog, these are now limited to short distances and require frequent rest breaks due to pain and fatigue. Her activities have become predominantly sedentary and home-based, with even passive leisure pursuits such as watching television proving challenging due to her ongoing concentration difficulties. She has been forced to cancel her planned trip to Cuba, and her social interactions have become  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 19 of 25\n\nseverely limited, consisting mainly of phone calls and brief visits from friends who primarily come to deliver supplies.  The reduction in leisure participation can be attributed to several interrelated factors. Physical limitations significantly impact her mobility and endurance, while persistent pain makes both prolonged   sitting   and   standing   difficult.   Her   developing   anxiety   about   leaving   home, compounded by her inability to drive, has created substantial transportation barriers. These challenges have led to increasing social withdrawal. Cognitive changes have diminished her ability to focus on and enjoy previously pleasurable activities.  This   marked   decrease   in   leisure   engagement   represents   a   significant   change   from   her pre-accident lifestyle and has contributed to her overall sense of isolation and diminished quality of life.  ASSESSMENT OF ATTENDANT CARE NEEDS:  The following is an Assessment of Attendant Care Needs based on reports of the client and direct observations as of October 29, 2024 . The Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists report “Considerations for Occupational Therapists Completing an Assessment of Attendant Care Needs (Form 1)” was consulted for the completion of the assessment. As per the OSOT Guidelines, “this assessment of Attendant Care Needs (Form 1) is not simply the recording of what attendant care services are already in place. [This therapist’s] role is to determine the extent to which the client can perform the skills and activities identified in the Form 1 safely, functionally, and to objectively identify what assistance if any is needed from the present time into the future until another such re-assessment may identify modified needs.”  P art 1 - Level 1 Attendant Care (Routine personal care)  Dressing | Pre: Independent | Post: Partially Able Ms. Slykhuis requires assistance with upper body dressing, particularly with bra donning and breast bandaging due to pain and limited range of motion. She remains independent with lower body dressing but requires increased time and experiences significant pain. She demonstrates difficulty with items requiring fine motor skills such as buttons and zippers.  At this time, Ms. Slykhuis requires 15 minutes of daily assistance for dressing tasks, particularly focusing on upper body dressing and support with fasteners.  Total Time Allotted: 105 minutes weekly  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 20 of 25\n\nUndressing | Pre: Independent | Post: Partially Able See comments under Dressing. Ms. Slykhuis requires similar assistance with undressing, particularly for upper body garments and breast bandage removal.  Total Time Allotted: 70 minutes weekly  Prosthetics | Pre: Not Applicable | Post: Not Applicable Total Time Allotted: 0 minutes weekly  Orthotics | Pre: Not Applicable | Post: Not Applicable Total Time Allotted: 0 minutes weekly  Grooming | Pre: Independent | Post: Partially Able Ms. Slykhuis requires assistance with several aspects of grooming due to pain, limited range of motion in her upper extremities, and difficulty with sustained positioning. She has particular difficulty with hair care, requiring assistance with washing and styling due to inability to maintain arms above shoulder height.  She is independent with basic face washing and teeth brushing but requires increased time and modifications. She requires assistance with nail care due to inability to maintain required positions and fine motor challenges.  Currently requires:  ●   15 minutes daily for hair care and styling  ●   10 minutes weekly for nail care  ●   10 minutes weekly for assistance with more complex grooming tasks  Total Time Allotted: 125 minutes weekly  Feeding | Pre: Independent | Post: Partially Able While Ms. Slykhuis remains independent with the actual task of feeding herself, she requires significant assistance with meal preparation due to pain with reaching, limited ability to lift cooking items, and cognitive challenges affecting meal planning and execution. She requires 45 minutes daily of assistance with meal preparation to ensure adequate nutrition.  Total Time Allotted: 315 minutes weekly  Mobility | Pre: Independent | Post: Partially Able Ms. Slykhuis requires standby assistance for safety during more challenging transfers and when navigating stairs due to balance impairment and pain. She requires assistance with community mobility due to inability to drive and anxiety as a passenger. She currently requires:  ●   20 minutes daily for supervision with more challenging transfers and stair navigation  ●   3 hours weekly for assistance with essential community mobility (medical appointments, essential errands)  Total Time Allotted: 320 minutes weekly  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 21 of 25\n\nExtra Laundering | Pre: Not Applicable | Post: Not Applicable Total Time Allotted: 0 minutes weekly  Hygiene | Pre: Independent | Post: Partially Able  Part 2: Level 2 Attendant Care (Basic supervisory functions)  The \"Assessment of Attendant Care Needs\" guidelines set forth by the Ontario Society of Occupational Therapists considers \"supervisory functions for those who are emotionally, cognitively and/or physically in need of comfort (e.g. advocating for a child or someone who is cognitively impaired)\". The OSOT guidelines further state that the \"family may be ensuring comfort, safety and security in this environment and these activities should be considered an attendant care need under Level 2\".  Ms. Slykhuis requires assistance with maintaining bathroom and bedroom hygiene due to physical limitations and pain with bending/reaching. She needs support with:  ●   Bathroom cleaning and maintenance (wiping surfaces, cleaning shower)  ●   Changing bed linens  ●   Managing laundry  ●   Organizing personal items within reach  ●   Ensuring comfort and safety in bedroom environment  Additionally, due to her cognitive challenges and emotional state, she requires support to ensure comfort and security throughout the day. She demonstrates significant anxiety and depression symptoms that impact her ability to maintain routines and engage in daily activities.  Currently requires:  ●   20 minutes daily for bathroom and bedroom hygiene tasks  ●   15 minutes four times daily for comfort and security needs  ●   15 minutes daily for support with organizing daily care items and maintaining safe environment  Total Time Allotted: 665 minutes weekly  Basic Supervisory Care | Pre: Not Applicable | Post: Partially Able In the event of an emergency requiring evacuation, Ms. Slykhuis's physical limitations, cognitive challenges, and use of sleep medications may impact her ability to respond appropriately. Given her balance impairment and need for a mobility aid, she would benefit from 30 minutes daily of basic supervisory care to ensure safety, particularly during evening hours.  Total Time Allotted: 210 minutes weekly  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 22 of 25\n\nPart 3: Level 3 Attendant Care (Complex health/care functions)  Medication | Pre: Independent | Post: Partially Able Due to cognitive changes affecting memory and organization, Ms. Slykhuis requires:  ●   10 minutes daily for medication monitoring and reminders  ●   5 minutes daily for maintenance of medication schedule and supplies  Total Time Allotted: 105 minutes weekly  Bathing | Pre: Independent | Post: Partially Able Ms. Slykhuis requires assistance with showering due to balance impairment, pain with reaching movements, and difficulty managing water temperature/controls. She requires:  ●   Setup of shower equipment  ●   Assistance with water temperature adjustment  ●   Standby assistance for safety during transfers  ●   Help with washing hair and hard-to-reach areas  ●   Support with drying and dressing after bathing  Currently requires 30 minutes daily assistance for safe completion of bathing activities.  Total Time Allotted: 210 minutes weekly  All other Level 3 categories (Genitourinary Tracts, Bowel Care, Tracheostomy Care, Ventilator Care, Exercise, Skin Care, Other Therapy, Supplies/Equipment, Skilled Supervision) are either not applicable or Ms. Slykhuis is independent with these tasks.  Total recommended monthly attendant care benefit: $2352.90  ●   Level 1 for routine personal care: 935 weekly minutes  ●   Level 2 for basic supervisory functions: 875 weekly minutes  ●   Level 3 for complex functions: 315 weekly minutes  REBUTTAL TO INSURER'S EXAMINATION REPORT Independent Examination - Occupational Therapy Examiner: Mr. Mohan Iyengar, OT Reg.(Ont.), dated October 8, 2024  After careful review of Mr. Iyengar's occupational therapy assessment dated October 8, 2024, completed in a notably brief 90-minute session, several significant concerns arise regarding the adequacy and accuracy of his findings. The assessment appears to substantially underestimate Ms. Slykhuis's functional limitations and care needs, potentially compromising her access to appropriate support and rehabilitation services.  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 23 of 25\n\nOf particular concern is Mr. Iyengar's evaluation of Ms. Slykhuis's cognitive function. His report suggests that she \"was able to attend to all aspects of the assessment and instructions,\" noting only \"some cognitive difficulties in the form of low mood and anxiety.\" This characterization drastically   understates   the   severity   and   complexity   of   her   cognitive   impairments.   This therapist's comprehensive assessment revealed pronounced executive dysfunction manifesting in   significant   financial   management   difficulties,   including   episodes   of   compulsive   online shopping and gambling that required therapeutic intervention. These behaviors, which resulted in substantial financial losses, clearly demonstrate impaired judgment and impulse control that Mr. Iyengar's brief observational assessment failed to capture.  The physical assessment conducted by Mr. Iyengar similarly falls short of capturing the true extent of Ms. Slykhuis's functional limitations. His reliance on isolated measurements, such as grip strength, fails to account for the complex interplay of pain, fatigue, and functional capacity that impacts her daily activities. While he notes grip strengths of 32 and 32.5 pounds, he fails to consider how sustained activity, reaching movements, and the need for postural adjustments significantly impact her ability to perform everyday tasks. This oversight is particularly evident in his evaluation of her activity tolerance.  Mr. Iyengar's assessment of fatigue and endurance based on a single 60-minute interview session fundamentally misrepresents Ms. Slykhuis's daily reality. His report fails to acknowledge the variable and cumulative nature of her fatigue, which necessitates multiple rest periods throughout the day. She experiences significant afternoon fatigue (described in her own words as \"c'est la que ca frappe\"), yet this pattern of deteriorating function and its impact on daily activities is notably absent from Mr. Iyengar's findings.  Perhaps most concerning is Mr. Iyengar's dismissal of psychological impacts on function. His assertion that Ms. Slykhuis \"seemed to be stable and showed no signs of anxiety during this assessment\" demonstrates a troubling failure to recognize the significant psychological barriers she   faces.   This   therapist's   assessment   documented   severe   anxiety   related   to   vehicular transportation,   resulting   in   substantial   avoidance   behaviors   that   significantly   impact   her community participation. The presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms, including intrusive thoughts and flashbacks, along with sleep disruption due to nightmares, creates a complex web of psychological barriers that profoundly affect her daily function.  These oversights culminate in Mr. Iyengar's remarkably low assessment of attendant care needs, recommending   only   $497.14   monthly   compared   to   this   therapist's   evidence-based determination of $2,352.90. His allocation of 315 weekly minutes for Level 1 Personal care, 115 minutes for Level 2 Basic Supervisory care, and mere 30 minutes for Level 3 Complex Functions fails   to   account for the comprehensive nature of Ms. Slykhuis's care requirements. This discrepancy appears to stem from a systematic underestimation of time required for tasks, a failure to consider fatigue impacts, and most notably, an oversight of the cognitive supervision needs   and   psychological   support   requirements   that   this   therapist's   assessment   carefully documented.  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 24 of 25\n\nMr. Iyengar's assessment methodology appears to rely heavily on brief observational data gathered during a single 90-minute session while disregarding substantial evidence of functional impairment   across   multiple   domains.   This   approach   has   resulted   in   an   incomplete and potentially misleading picture of Ms. Slykhuis's functional status and care needs. This therapist's comprehensive assessment, which considers the complex interplay of physical, cognitive, and psychological factors affecting daily function, provides a more accurate representation of her current status and care requirements. The significant disparity between these assessments raises serious concerns about the adequacy of Mr. Iyengar's evaluation and its potential impact on Ms. Slykhuis's access to necessary care and support services.  CLOSING COMMENTS:  This assessment has revealed that Ms. Slykhuis continues to experience significant physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges following her motor vehicle accident of August 26, 2023. These impairments substantially impact her ability to perform activities of daily living independently and safely. The recommended supports and services are essential to promote her ongoing recovery and ensure her safety in the community.

    "MEDICAL_HISTORY": "●   Occupational Therapy Initial Assessment Report by Stephanie Bosse, dated October 12, 2023  ●   Progress Report by Kaylee Kozera OT, dated January 9, 2024  ●   Psychological Assessment Report by Dr. Jeremy Frank, dated November 13, 2023  ●   Clinical notes from Dr. Sophie Gauthier (Family Physician)  ●   Sleep Medicine consultation note from Dr. Alan Lowe dated October 17, 2023  ●   Various hospital and clinical records from August-December 2023  PRE-ACCIDENT MEDICAL HISTORY:  Prior to the subject accident, Ms. Slykhuis had a history of:  ●   Depression managed with medication and psychiatric follow-up  ●   Deep Vein Thrombosis (2019) and Pulmonary Embolism (2020) requiring blood thinners  ●   Sleep disturbance requiring medication  ●   Left frozen shoulder (2021)  ●   Sleep apnea diagnosed January 2023  Despite these conditions, Ms. Slykhuis was able to maintain full-time and part-time employment, manage her home independently, and engage actively in social activities. Her pre-existing conditions were well-managed and did not significantly impact her daily functioning at the time of the accident.  MECHANISM OF INJURY:  On August 26, 2023, Ms. Slykhuis was a belted passenger in a vehicle that was struck at high speed by another vehicle. The impact occurred on the passenger side, causing their vehicle to spin   before landing in a ditch. Ms. Slykhuis has limited recall of the incident itself but remembers gripping tightly to the left side with both hands, opening her eyes to find herself in the ditch, and experiencing severe chest pain. Her 17-year-old son attended the scene. She was assessed by emergency services and transported to Cornwall Community Hospital.  NATURE OF INJURY:  Based on medical documentation reviewed and client report, Ms. Slykhuis sustained the following injuries as a result of the subject motor vehicle accident:  ●   Left breast traumatic injury with multifocal hematomas requiring surgical aspiration  ●   Displaced left rib fracture  ●   Undisplaced mid-sternal fracture  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 6 of 25",
    "TYPICAL_DAY": "Memory deficits were consistently observed throughout the assessment. Ms. Slykhuis relied heavily on written notes for basic information such as appointment dates and medication details. She demonstrated difficulty with temporal sequencing of recent events and showed inconsistent recall of medical appointments. Her attempts at independent problem-solving were often ineffective, requiring structured guidance to develop and implement practical solutions.  The assessment process revealed notable challenges with sustained attention and task persistence. These difficulties manifested in her need for frequent redirection and tendency to lose track of conversations, particularly as fatigue increased throughout the session. This presentation is consistent with her reported difficulties in managing daily activities and suggests a significant change from her pre-accident level of cognitive functioning.  A number of concerning behaviours demonstrating impulsivity, lack of judgement and lack of self-awareness we observed and documented later in this report under the financial management section.  TYPICAL DAY:  Based on Ms. Slykhuis's report during the assessment, her current daily routine consists of the following:  Morning Routine: She typically wakes between 7:00-8:30 AM, often after a disrupted night's sleep due to pain and nightmares. She takes her dog for a brief morning walk, though she reports this is challenging due to pain and requires frequent stops. After returning home, she reports needing to lie down to recover from this activity.  She will make a simple breakfast shake or coffee and move to her living room sofa. She attempts to check emails but reports this is often challenging due to concentration difficulties and physical discomfort when sitting at her computer. She requires frequent position changes and often needs to lie down after 20-30 minutes of sitting upright.  Afternoon Activities: Around noon, she takes her dog out again, typically sitting outside while throwing a frisbee rather than walking due to increased pain and fatigue. She relies on reheating prepared foods for lunch as she reports difficulty with meal preparation tasks.  She typically needs to rest in bed around 1:00 PM, describing this as the time when her symptoms are most severe (\"c'est la que ca frappe\" –   “that’s when it hits me” ). After resting, she attempts some light housekeeping tasks such as loading/unloading the dishwasher or light tidying, but reports these activities often increase her pain significantly.

Washing her hair was an ordeal she could only manage with the assistance of her PSW, as standing in the shower often left her feeling extremely dizzy. To alleviate this, her PSW would keep the shower door open, providing a sense of security and immediate aid if needed.

    "ATTENDANT_CARE": "Of particular concern is Mr. Iyengar's evaluation of Ms. Slykhuis's cognitive function. His report suggests that she \"was able to attend to all aspects of the assessment and instructions,\" noting only \"some cognitive difficulties in the form of low mood and anxiety.\" This characterization drastically   understates   the   severity   and   complexity   of   her   cognitive   impairments.   This therapist's comprehensive assessment revealed pronounced executive dysfunction manifesting in   significant   financial   management   difficulties,   including   episodes   of   compulsive   online shopping and gambling that required therapeutic intervention. These behaviors, which resulted in substantial financial losses, clearly demonstrate impaired judgment and impulse control that Mr. Iyengar's brief observational assessment failed to capture.  The physical assessment conducted by Mr. Iyengar similarly falls short of capturing the true extent of Ms. Slykhuis's functional limitations. His reliance on isolated measurements, such as grip strength, fails to account for the complex interplay of pain, fatigue, and functional capacity that impacts her daily activities. While he notes grip strengths of 32 and 32.5 pounds, he fails to consider how sustained activity, reaching movements, and the need for postural adjustments significantly impact her ability to perform everyday tasks. This oversight is particularly evident in his evaluation of her activity tolerance.  Mr. Iyengar's assessment of fatigue and endurance based on a single 60-minute interview session fundamentally misrepresents Ms. Slykhuis's daily reality. His report fails to acknowledge the variable and cumulative nature of her fatigue, which necessitates multiple rest periods throughout the day. She experiences significant afternoon fatigue (described in her own words as \"c'est la que ca frappe\"), yet this pattern of deteriorating function and its impact on daily activities is notably absent from Mr. Iyengar's findings.  Perhaps most concerning is Mr. Iyengar's dismissal of psychological impacts on function. His assertion that Ms. Slykhuis \"seemed to be stable and showed no signs of anxiety during this assessment\" demonstrates a troubling failure to recognize the significant psychological barriers she   faces.   This   therapist's   assessment   documented   severe   anxiety   related   to   vehicular transportation,   resulting   in   substantial   avoidance   behaviors   that   significantly   impact   her community participation. The presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms, including intrusive thoughts and flashbacks, along with sleep disruption due to nightmares, creates a complex web of psychological barriers that profoundly affect her daily function.  These oversights culminate in Mr. Iyengar's remarkably low assessment of attendant care needs, recommending   only   $497.14   monthly   compared   to   this   therapist's   evidence-based determination of $2,352.90. His allocation of 315 weekly minutes for Level 1 Personal care, 115 minutes for Level 2 Basic Supervisory care, and mere 30 minutes for Level 3 Complex Functions fails   to   account for the comprehensive nature of Ms. Slykhuis's care requirements. This discrepancy appears to stem from a systematic underestimation of time required for tasks, a failure to consider fatigue impacts, and most notably, an oversight of the cognitive supervision needs   and   psychological   support   requirements   that   this   therapist's   assessment   carefully documented.  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 24 of 25",
    "FUNCTIONAL_STATUS": "Mr. Iyengar's assessment methodology appears to rely heavily on brief observational data gathered during a single 90-minute session while disregarding substantial evidence of functional impairment   across   multiple   domains.   This   approach   has   resulted   in   an   incomplete and potentially misleading picture of Ms. Slykhuis's functional status and care needs. This therapist's comprehensive assessment, which considers the complex interplay of physical, cognitive, and psychological factors affecting daily function, provides a more accurate representation of her current status and care requirements. The significant disparity between these assessments raises serious concerns about the adequacy of Mr. Iyengar's evaluation and its potential impact on Ms. Slykhuis's access to necessary care and support services.  CLOSING COMMENTS:  This assessment has revealed that Ms. Slykhuis continues to experience significant physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges following her motor vehicle accident of August 26, 2023. These impairments substantially impact her ability to perform activities of daily living independently and safely. The recommended supports and services are essential to promote her ongoing recovery and ensure her safety in the community.

Her pre-existing conditions were well-managed and did not significantly impact her daily functioning at the time of the accident.  MECHANISM OF INJURY:  On August 26, 2023, Ms. Slykhuis was a belted passenger in a vehicle that was struck at high speed by another vehicle. The impact occurred on the passenger side, causing their vehicle to spin   before landing in a ditch. Ms. Slykhuis has limited recall of the incident itself but remembers gripping tightly to the left side with both hands, opening her eyes to find herself in the ditch, and experiencing severe chest pain. Her 17-year-old son attended the scene. She was assessed by emergency services and transported to Cornwall Community Hospital.  NATURE OF INJURY:  Based on medical documentation reviewed and client report, Ms. Slykhuis sustained the following injuries as a result of the subject motor vehicle accident:  ●   Left breast traumatic injury with multifocal hematomas requiring surgical aspiration  ●   Displaced left rib fracture  ●   Undisplaced mid-sternal fracture  Veronique Slykhuis   Claim #: 1945485   Page 6 of 25",

        "Memory deficits were consistently observed throughout the assessment. Ms. Slykhuis relied heavily on written notes for basic information such as appointment dates and medication details. She demonstrated difficulty with temporal sequencing of recent events and showed inconsistent recall of medical appointments. Her attempts at independent problem-solving were often ineffective, requiring structured guidance to develop and implement practical solutions.  The assessment process revealed notable challenges with sustained attention and task persistence. These difficulties manifested in her need for frequent redirection and tendency to lose track of conversations, particularly as fatigue increased throughout the session. This presentation is consistent with her reported difficulties in managing daily activities and suggests a significant change from her pre-accident level of cognitive functioning.  A number of concerning behaviours demonstrating impulsivity, lack of judgement and lack of self-awareness we observed and documented later in this report under the financial management section.  TYPICAL DAY:  Based on Ms. Slykhuis's report during the assessment, her current daily routine consists of the following:  Morning Routine: She typically wakes between 7:00-8:30 AM, often after a disrupted night's sleep due to pain and nightmares. She takes her dog for a brief morning walk, though she reports this is challenging due to pain and requires frequent stops. After returning home, she reports needing to lie down to recover from this activity.  She will make a simple breakfast shake or coffee and move to her living room sofa. She attempts to check emails but reports this is often challenging due to concentration difficulties and physical discomfort when sitting at her computer. She requires frequent position changes and often needs to lie down after 20-30 minutes of sitting upright.  Afternoon Activities: Around noon, she takes her dog out again, typically sitting outside while throwing a frisbee rather than walking due to increased pain and fatigue. She relies on reheating prepared foods for lunch as she reports difficulty with meal preparation tasks.  She typically needs to rest in bed around 1:00 PM, describing this as the time when her symptoms are most severe (\"c'est la que ca frappe\" –   “that’s when it hits me” ). After resting, she attempts some light housekeeping tasks such as loading/unloading the dishwasher or light tidying, but reports these activities often increase her pain significantly.

      "notes": "Of particular concern is Mr. Iyengar's evaluation of Ms. Slykhuis's cognitive function. His report suggests that she \"was able to attend to all aspects of the assessment and instructions,\" noting only \"some cognitive difficulties in the form of low mood and anxiety.\" This characterization drastically   understates   the   severity   and   complexity   of   her   cognitive   impairments.   This therapist's comprehensive assessment revealed pronounced executive dysfunction manifesting in   significant   financial   management   difficulties,   including   episodes   of   compulsive   online shopping and gambling that required therapeutic intervention. These behaviors, which resulted in substantial financial losses, clearly demonstrate impaired judgment and impulse control that Mr. Iyengar's brief observational assessment failed to capture.  The physical assessment conducted by Mr. Iyengar similarly falls short of capturing the true extent of Ms. Slykhuis's functional limitations. His reliance on isolated measurements, such as grip strength, fails to account for the complex interplay of pain, fatigue, and functional capacity that impacts her daily activities. While he notes grip strengths of 32 and 32.5 pounds, he fails to consider how sustained activity, reaching movements, and the need for postural adjustments significantly impact her ability to perform everyday tasks. This oversight is particularly evident in his evaluation of her activity tolerance.  Mr. Iyengar's assessment of fatigue and endurance based on a single 60-minute interview session fundamentally misrepresents Ms. Slykhuis's daily reality. His report fails to acknowledge the variable and cumulative nature of her fatigue, which necessitates multiple rest periods throughout the day. She experiences significant afternoon fatigue (described in her own words as \"c'est la que ca frappe\"), yet this pattern of deteriorating function and its impact on daily activities is notably absent from Mr. Iyengar's findings.  Perhaps most concerning is Mr. Iyengar's dismissal of psychological impacts on function. His assertion that Ms. Slykhuis \"seemed to be stable and showed no signs of anxiety during this assessment\" demonstrates a troubling failure to recognize the significant psychological barriers she   faces.   This   therapist's   assessment   documented   severe   anxiety   related   to   vehicular transportation,   resulting   in   substantial   avoidance   behaviors   that   significantly   impact   her community participation. The presence of post-traumatic stress symptoms, including intrusive thoughts and flashbacks, along with sleep disruption due to nightmares, creates a complex web of psychological barriers that profoundly affect her daily function.  These oversights culminate in Mr. Iyengar's remarkably low assessment of attendant care needs, recommending   only   $497.14   monthly   compared   to   this   therapist's   evidence-based determination of $2,352.90. His allocation of 315 weekly minutes for Level 1 Personal care, 115 minutes for Level 2 Basic Supervisory care, and mere 30 minutes for Level 3 Complex Functions fails   to   account for the comprehensive nature of Ms. Slykhuis's care requirements. This discrepancy appears to stem from a systematic underestimation of time required for tasks, a failure to consider fatigue impacts, and most notably, an oversight of the cognitive supervision needs   and   psychological   support   requirements   that   this   therapist's   assessment   carefully documented.

      "notes": "Mr. Iyengar's assessment methodology appears to rely heavily on brief observational data gathered during a single 90-minute session while disregarding substantial evidence of functional impairment   across   multiple   domains.   This   approach   has   resulted   in   an   incomplete and potentially misleading picture of Ms. Slykhuis's functional status and care needs. This therapist's comprehensive assessment, which considers the complex interplay of physical, cognitive, and psychological factors affecting daily function, provides a more accurate representation of her current status and care requirements. The significant disparity between these assessments raises serious concerns about the adequacy of Mr. Iyengar's evaluation and its potential impact on Ms. Slykhuis's access to necessary care and support services.  CLOSING COMMENTS:  This assessment has revealed that Ms. Slykhuis continues to experience significant physical, cognitive, and emotional challenges following her motor vehicle accident of August 26, 2023. These impairments substantially impact her ability to perform activities of daily living independently and safely. The recommended supports and services are essential to promote her ongoing recovery and ensure her safety in the community.
