Catastrophic Impairment Rating, Chapter 14 of the AMA Guides specifically recommends evaluation in four areas of functioning, including activities of daily living, capacity for social interaction, concentration, pace and persistence, and adaptation to work or work-like environments.  These are discussed as follows:\n\n\n\nActivities of daily living\n\nAs per the Guides, \"Activities of daily living include such activities as self-care, personal hygiene, communication (addressed in this assessment under social functioning), ambulation, travel, sexual function, sleep, and social and recreational activities....In the context of the individual's overall situation, the quality of these activities is judged by their independence, appropriateness, effectiveness, and sustainability. It is necessary to define the extent to which the individual is capable of initiating and participating in these activities independent of supervision or direction. What is assessed is not simply the number of activities that are restricted, but the overall degree of restriction or combination of restrictions\".\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf-Care and Personal Hygiene\n\n\n\n\n\nCommunication\n\n\n\n\n\nAmbulation\n\n\n\n\t\n\nSexual Function\n\n\n\n\n\nSleep\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial and Recreational Activities\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial functioning\n\n\n\nConcentration, Persistence and Pace\n\nAs per the Guides, “Concentration, persistence and pace needed to perform many activities of daily living, including task completion. Task completion refers to the ability to sustain focussed attention long enough to permit the timely completion of tasks commonly found in activities of daily living or work settings...Strengths and weaknesses in mental concentration may be described in terms of frequency of errors, the time it takes to complete the task, and the extent to which assistance is required to complete the task”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeterioration or Decompensation in Work or Work-like Settings (Adaptation)\n\nAs per the Guides, “Deterioration or decompensation in work or work like settings refers to repeated failure to adapt to stressful circumstances. In the face of such circumstances, the individual may withdraw from the situation or experience exacerbation signs and symptoms....he or HE/SHE may decompensate and have difficulty maintaining activities of daily living, continuing social relationships, and completing tasks.
