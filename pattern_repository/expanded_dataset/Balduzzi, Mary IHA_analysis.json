PURPOSE OF REFERRAL :  To perform an assessment with respect to   Ms.   Balduzzi ’s ability to manage those functional  activitie s   Ms.   Balduzzi   was responsible for prior to the motor vehicle accident of   2017 - 02 - 14 .  SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:  Ms. Balduzzi   is an 85 - year - old woman who   was involved in a car vs. pedestrian collision while  she was walking from her car to a Tim Horton ’ s restaurant on   February 14, 2017.   As a result of  the subject motor vehicle accident, Ms. Balduzzi   sustained the following injuries:  •   Fractured left ankle (ORI F , 13 screws and a plate)  •   Laceration below the   left   k nee  •   Subsequent   MRSA   infection   in the leg  Following her accident, Ms. Bal duzzi was hospitalized for a period of o ver 5 mon ths, finally  being discharged home from Elizabeth Bruy è re   hospital   on   July 20, 2017.   She underwent a  course of physiotherapy and obtained some support from an   occupational   therapist. Overall, her  medical cond ition has been monitored by her family physician with limited   additional resources.  Ms.   Balduzzi ’ s past medical   history   is positive for   the following conditions:  •   Complete reversed shoulder replacement   in   2010, left - sided ,   as a result of a slip and fall  where she   shattered   her   shoulder.  •   Hypothyroidism  •   Sleep apnea  •   Thallasemia trait  •   Osteoporosis  As a result of her shoulde r - related impairments, Ms. Balduzzi reported that she obtained assistance  with   showering an d   hair care once weekly from a Personal Support Worker provided through   the  CCAC .   She noted that she was   r equired   to increase the   frequency   of her PSW support to   twice  weekly post - accident.  From a symptom perspective, Ms. Balduzzi is report ing   ongoing pain i n her left   lower leg and  lower back.   These symptoms   cou pled with the significant   degree of deco nditioning which has  taken place have resulted in a complete interruption in her ability to engage   in her daily activities.  Ms. Balduzzi proudly expressed how well she functioned pre - accident and her daughter Linda  echoed this sentiment. Ms. Balduzzi noted that sh e   only relied   on assistance once per week from  a PSW   pre - accident   due to limitations to her left .   Ms. Balduzzi explai ned that she was able to\n\nDate of Report:   2019 - 04 - 24  ______________________________________________________________________________  Mary   Balduzzi   Claim #:   APP 2699699   Page   3   of   15  manage all of   self - care functions independently with the exception of bathing   and shampooing her  hair.   She reported that she was   “ out and about   all of the time ” . She rarely   ate at home, choosing  to eat - out   many   meals which afforded a degre e of distraction   and quality of life. She   drove h erself  from one community location to an other thr o u gh ou t the day and   was self - reliant i n   all of her self -  care needs.  At t he time of this assessment, Ms. Balduzzi explained that she has been   “ a pr isoner   in my home ”  for over two years. Her significant mobility restrictions resulting from her accident - related injuries  has had a profound impact on her ability to care for herself   leading to a sharp deterioration in her  quality of life. Ms. Balduzzi ’ s mo bility has been affected to such a degree   that she cannot (safely  or without   assistance) man age the front step s leading out of her home.   She has   now wears  nightgowns at all time s   of the day eliminating the need to change   her clothes regul arly   and   she  requires assistance to don o utdoor footwear .   She   noted that   she was required to purchase new  wardrobe items to replace the on es she cannot don or doff   independently .   She no longer leaves  her home to access restaurants to eat her meals and as a result, relies on frozen dinners   or dinners  cooked by her daughter Linda to meet her dietary needs. She will at times supplement these meals  with some steamed vegetables but is unable to cook a meal from scratch   independently .  As a result of her 2010 shoulder injury and   subsequent   surgery, Ms.   Balduzzi relied   on some  assistance for the heavier   and more p hysical aspects of maintaining her home. She reported that  her   neighbour   would assist with cutting her lawn while she hired a snow removal contractor in the  winter to maint ain her driveway and provide access to her car garage.   She reported that her  dau ghter   assisted her with heavier indoor   housekeeping   tasks such as vacuuming and m opping  wh ile her PSW cleaned the bath tub weekly.   Ms. Balduzzi remained independent with the  management   of swe eping, laundry,   garbage   removal   and d usting.   At this time, Ms. Balduzzi has  completely interrupted her involvement in any form of housekeeping or home maintenance  activities.  Prior to the subject m otor vehicle accident, Ms. Balduzzi noted that she was highly active in the  community and engaged in the following   leisure acti vities:  •   Attended c hurch   weekly  •   Went to the   Casino  •   Dined out 4   –   5x per week  •   Went s hopping   at local malls / s tores  •   Attended f amily   gatherings  •   Spent t ime with   her   grandchildren  •   Travelled abroad   ( went to   Hong Kong and Hawaii)  At this juncture, Ms. Balduzzi has completely interrupted her pre - accident pace of life.   She no  longer goes to ch urch and no longer attends the Casino.   She will go out for dinner only when  family members invite her out and she no   longer   enjoys   shopping. She reports limited time spent  with her grandchildren large ly as a result of her   limited ability to get out of her home.   She has not  travelled since the accident .  Since the last   A ssessment of Attendant Care Needs performed   on   July 2 0, 2018, there has been no  substantive change in the level of care required by Ms. Balduzzi   with the exception   of an assessed\n\nDate of Report:   2019 - 04 - 24  ______________________________________________________________________________  Mary   Balduzzi   Claim #:   APP 2699699   Page   4   of   15  need for 24 - hour care as opposed to 8 - hour care previously assessed due to he r   inability to exit her  h ome in   case of an emergency   at all times .   In this therapist ’ s opinion, Ms. Balduzzi ’ s level of  deconditioning due to her   limited activity levels   has resulted in a deterioration of her mobility.  She is not, in this therapist ’ s opinion, able to exit her   home in case of an emergency at any time of  day.   While previously found to be self - sufficient during waking hours, this   therapist   believes that  she is now completely dependent on care to   safely exit her   home in   case   of an emerg ency such as  a fire. All other aspects of care remain the same .  RECOMMENDATIONS:  Attendant Care:  Ms. Balduzzi is found to have deteriorated with respect to her ability to be   self - sufficient in case  of an emergency . She is thus found to require 24 - hour care on this basis resulting in a significant  increase in her Attendant Care Needs monthly   assessed benefit. She   currently is assessed as  requiring   24 - hour care transla ting to a   monthly   benefit of $10193.63.  Housekeeping:  Ms. Balduzzi currently requires approxi mately 2 hours per week of housekeeping assistance to  h elp manage those housekeeping an d   home maintenance tasks she was responsible for prior to  her accident.  Assistive Devices:  Ms. Balduzzi ’ s needs for assistive devices   to further her functional recovery will be addressed  through the delivery of   Occupational Therapy treatment   proposed   below. There were no devices  currently indicated on an urgent basis to mitigate a nd risks to her safety.  Further   Occupational Therapy Interventions:  Ms. Balduzzi would benefit from   the provision of Occupat ional Therapy treatment to address her  home safety issues and specifically her   accessibility to   and from her   home. She is currently  unable to   safely manage the front stairs of her home and this has resulted in her remaining in her  home for the larger part o f the last 2 years.   Further interventions focussed on   improving her  quality of life will be address   as appropriate.

She has   now wears  nightgowns at all time of the day eliminating the need to change   her clothes regul arly   and requires  assistance to don o utdoor footwear .   She   noted that   she was required to purchase new wardrobe  items to replace the on es she cannot don or doff   independently .   She no longer leaves her home to  access restaurants to eat her meals and as a result, relies on frozen dinners   or dinners cooked by  her daughter Linda to meet her dietary needs. She will at times supplement these meals with some  steamed vegetables but is unable to cook a meal from scratch   independently .  Please refer to the Attendant Care section of this report for more information.  Pre and Post Accident   Home Management Activities:  As a result of her 2010 shoulder injury and   subsequent   surgery, Ms.   Balduzzi relied   on some  assistance for the heavier   and more p hysical aspects of maintaining her home. She reported that  her   neighbour   would assist with cutting her lawn while she hired a snow removal contractor in the  winter to maint ain her driveway and provide access to her car garage.   She reported that her  dau ghter   assisted her with heavier indoor   housekeeping   tasks such as vacuuming and m opping  wh ile her PSW cleaned the bath tub weekly.   Ms. Balduzzi remained independent with the  management   of swe eping, laundry,   garbage   removal   and d usting.  At   this   time,   Ms.   Balduzzi   has   completely interrupted   her   involvement   in   any form   of  housekeeping or home maintenance activities.   She is now in need of/receiving the following  assistance:  Sweeping   35 minutes per week  Laundry   60 minutes per week  Garbage   removal 15 minutes per week  Dusting   20 minutes per week  A total amount of   2 hours per week of assistance would be indicated to replace the housekeeping  services Ms. Balduzzi reported performing pre - accident.  Pre and Post Accident   Leisure Activities:  Prior to the subject m otor vehicle accident, Ms. Balduzzi noted that she was highly active in the  community and engaged in the following   leisure acti vities:  •   Attended c hurch   weekly  •   Went to the   Casino  •   Dined out 4   –   5x per week\n\nDate of Report:   2019 - 04 - 24  ______________________________________________________________________________  Mary   Balduzzi   Claim #:   APP 2699699   Page   15   of   15  •   Went s hopping   at local malls / s tores  •   Attended f amily   gatherings  •   Spent t ime with   her   grandchildren  •   Travelled abroad   ( went to   Hong Kong and Hawaii)  At this juncture, Ms. Balduzzi has completely interrupted her pre - accident pace of life.   She no  longer goes to ch urch and no longer attends the Casino.   She will go out for dinner only when  family members invite her out and she no   longer   enjoys   shopping. She reports limited time spent  with her grandchildren large ly as a result of her   limited ability to get out of her home.   She has not  travelled since the accident. She and her daughter Linda held an exc hange over family   plans to  take Ms. Balduzzi to Rome for a vacation in the summer of 2019   where Ms. Balduzzi became  combative   and indicated she did not wish to go.  ASSESSMENT OF ATTENDANT CARE NEEDS:  Since the last   A ssessment of Attendant Care Needs performed   on   July 2 0, 2018, there has been no  substantive change in the level of care required by Ms. Balduzzi   with the exception   of an assessed  need for 24 - hour care as opposed to 8 - hour care previously assessed due to he r   inability to exit her  h ome in   case of an emergency   at all times .   In this therapist ’ s opinion, Ms. Balduzzi ’ s level of  deconditioning due to her   limited activity levels   has resulted in a deterioration of her mobility.  She is not, in this therapist ’ s opinion, able to exit her   home in case of an emergency at any time of  day.   While previously found to be self - sufficient during waking hours, this   therapist   believes that  she is now completely dependent on care to   safely exit her   home in   case   of an emerg ency such as  a fire. All other aspects of care remain the same .   Please refer to the enclosed Form 1 for more  details.

She no  longer goes to ch urch and no longer attends the Casino.   She will go out for dinner only when  family members invite her out and she no   longer   enjoys   shopping. She reports limited time spent  with her grandchildren large ly as a result of her   limited ability to get out of her home.   She has not  travelled since the accident. She and her daughter Linda held an exc hange over family   plans to  take Ms. Balduzzi to Rome for a vacation in the summer of 2019   where Ms. Balduzzi became  combative   and indicated she did not wish to go.  ASSESSMENT OF ATTENDANT CARE NEEDS:  Since the last   A ssessment of Attendant Care Needs performed   on   July 2 0, 2018, there has been no  substantive change in the level of care required by Ms. Balduzzi   with the exception   of an assessed  need for 24 - hour care as opposed to 8 - hour care previously assessed due to he r   inability to exit her  h ome in   case of an emergency   at all times .   In this therapist ’ s opinion, Ms. Balduzzi ’ s level of  deconditioning due to her   limited activity levels   has resulted in a deterioration of her mobility.  She is not, in this therapist ’ s opinion, able to exit her   home in case of an emergency at any time of  day.   While previously found to be self - sufficient during waking hours, this   therapist   believes that  she is now completely dependent on care to   safely exit her   home in   case   of an emerg ency such as  a fire. All other aspects of care remain the same .   Please refer to the enclosed Form 1 for more  details.  Please refer to the enclosed Assessment of Attendant Care Needs Form (Form 1) for more  information.
