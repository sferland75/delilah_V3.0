# Missing Radix UI Tooltip Dependency Fix

## Issue

The application was failing to compile with the following error:

```
Uncaught Error: Module not found: Can't resolve '@radix-ui/react-tooltip'
```

This error occurred because:
1. The tooltip component was trying to use `@radix-ui/react-tooltip` but the package wasn't installed
2. The tooltip component was being used in the SectionCompleteness component

## Solutions

### Immediate Fix

1. **Simplified Tooltip Implementation**
   - Created a basic tooltip component that doesn't rely on Radix UI
   - This simplified version maintains the same API but without actual tooltip functionality
   - Modified SectionCompleteness to use the HTML title attribute as a fallback

2. **Package Installation**
   - Created a batch file `package-install.bat` that can be run to install the missing package
   - Once installed, the proper tooltip functionality will be available

### How to Install the Package

Run the provided batch file to install the missing dependency:

```
d:\delilah_V3.0\package-install.bat
```

Or manually install it using npm:

```
npm install @radix-ui/react-tooltip
```

After installation, restart your development server for the changes to take effect.

## Why This Approach Works

The temporary implementation:
1. Maintains the same component API, so no changes to imports are needed
2. Allows the application to compile and run without errors
3. Provides a path to full functionality when the package is installed
4. Uses native HTML title attribute for basic tooltip functionality in the meantime

## Dependency Management

This issue highlights the importance of keeping your `package.json` dependencies in sync with what your code is actually using. Here are recommendations for the future:

1. Use a package management tool like npm or yarn to install dependencies
2. Run `npm install` after pulling new code to ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Consider adding a pre-commit hook to verify all imports have corresponding dependencies
