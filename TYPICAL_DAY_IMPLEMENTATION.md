# Typical Day Section Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the Typical Day section following the improved routing and component structure patterns outlined in the Delilah V3.0 documentation.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Component Structure

```
src/sections/6-TypicalDay/
├── SimpleTypicalDay.tsx     # Simplified version for independent use
├── EnhancedTypicalDay.tsx   # Enhanced version with full functionality
├── TypicalDaySection.tsx    # Integration component for assessment flow
├── schema.updated.ts        # Zod schema with type definitions
├── index.ts                 # Standardized exports
└── FIXES_APPLIED.md         # Documentation of fixes
```

### 2. Route Implementation

```
pages/
├── typical-day.tsx          # Standalone section page
└── full-assessment.tsx      # Integrated assessment flow
```

### 3. Key Features

- **Proper Schema Validation**: Uses Zod for robust schema validation
- **Error Handling**: Implements error boundaries at multiple levels
- **Responsive UI**: Adapts to various screen sizes with responsive grid
- **Sleep Schedule Support**: Handles both regular and irregular sleep patterns
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Provides graceful degradation when errors occur

### 4. Data Flow

1. **Loading from Context**:
   - Component loads data from AssessmentContext
   - Converts text-based activities to structured form data
   - Maps sleep schedule information correctly

2. **Saving to Context**:
   - Converts form data back to context format
   - Normalizes data structure to prevent nesting issues
   - Provides user feedback via toast notifications

### 5. Component Features

- **Tab-based Navigation**: Separate tabs for pre/post-accident data
- **Dynamic Activity Management**: Add/remove activities in each time period
- **Conditional UI**: Different UI based on sleep schedule type
- **Toast Notifications**: Replacing browser alerts with modern notifications
- **Loading States**: Proper loading indicators during data retrieval

### 6. Testing Approach

The implementation can be tested through:
1. **Direct Route**: Access `/typical-day` to test the component in isolation
2. **Assessment Flow**: Test via the Typical Day tab in `/full-assessment`
3. **Error Handling**: Verify error boundaries by introducing temporary issues

## Integration with Assessment Flow

The Typical Day section integrates with the full assessment through:
1. Dynamic imports in the full assessment page
2. Error boundaries to prevent full assessment failures
3. Standardized data handling via the AssessmentContext

## Compliance with Design Patterns

This implementation follows the recommended design patterns:
- Simplified components with minimal dependencies
- Error isolation through boundaries
- Consistent schema validation
- Standardized route patterns
- Proper context integration

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar patterns to remaining sections
2. Implement comprehensive testing suite
3. Add detailed component documentation
4. Optimize performance for large datasets
