# Functional Status Component Fix

## Problem
The Range of Motion component in the Functional Status section was causing rendering errors with:
```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined.
```

Additionally, there were DOM nesting warnings and React Hook Form props warnings.

## Solution
1. Completely rewrote the `RangeOfMotion.tsx` component with:
   - Direct implementation rather than re-exporting from SimpleRangeOfMotion
   - Both named and default exports for compatibility
   - Proper error handling with try/catch blocks

2. Fixed form structure to prevent nested forms by:
   - Using div containers instead of form elements
   - Utilizing Button with onClick handlers instead of form submission

## Files Modified
- `D:\delilah_V3.0\src\sections\5-FunctionalStatus\components\RangeOfMotion.tsx`

## Testing
Verify the following after applying the fix:
1. Functional Status tab loads without errors
2. Range of Motion subtab renders properly
3. Form fields can be filled and submitted
4. No console errors appear

## Additional Considerations
The same pattern should be applied to other form components to:
1. Eliminate DOM nesting warnings
2. Fix React Hook Form props warnings
3. Improve error handling
