## Development Guidelines

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
4. Access the application at http://localhost:3000

### Form Development

Use the `FormSectionBase` component for creating new form sections:

```typescript
export default function YourSection() {
  const formContent = (form, dataLoaded, isSaving) => (
    <div className="space-y-6">
      {/* Your form fields here */}
    </div>
  );
  
  return (
    <FormSectionBase
      title="Your Section"
      sectionId="yourSection"
      schema={yourSchema}
      defaultValues={defaultValues}
      mapContextToForm={mapContextToForm}
      mapFormToContext={mapFormToContext}
      formContent={formContent}
      nextSection="/full-assessment?section=next-section"
      previousSection="/full-assessment?section=previous-section"
    />
  );
}
```

### Report Template Development

Add new report templates in the templates.ts file:

```typescript
{
  id: 'your-template',
  name: 'Your Template',
  description: 'Description of your template',
  defaultTitle: 'Your Report Title',
  defaultStyle: 'clinical',
  category: 'your-category',
  isBuiltIn: true,
  defaultSections: [
    { id: 'section1', title: 'Section 1', included: true, detailLevel: 'standard' },
    // Add more sections
  ]
}
```

## Known Issues

See the open issues in the repository for a list of known issues and planned improvements.

## Future Development

1. **PDF Import Feature**: Resume development of pattern recognition for PDF imports
2. **Integration with External AI Services**: Connect to actual AI services for report generation
3. **Backend Integration**: Replace localStorage with proper backend persistence
4. **Mobile Optimization**: Enhance responsive design for mobile and tablet devices
