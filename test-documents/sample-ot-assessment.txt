Therapist: Sebastien Ferland OT Reg.(Ont.) Date of Assessment: 2021-11-23
Date of Report: 2021-11-24
THERAPIST QUALIFICATIONS:
Mr. Ferland is an Occupational Therapist with over 23 years of experience. His professional 
practice began in 1998 when he graduated Magna Cum Laude from the University of Ottawa and 
launched himself in the world of private business. Over the years, he has provided services to the 
automobile insurance and legal communities as well the WSIB, Veterans Affairs and the LongTerm Disability sector.
Mr. Ferland has extensive experience working with individuals suffering from catastrophic 
injuries. He provides assessment and treatment services as a primary Occupational Therapist as 
well as a Case Manager for individuals who sustained traumatic brain injuries, spinal cord injuries 
and amputations. He also has extensive experience working with individuals who have been 
deemed to meet the catastrophic threshold on the basis of psychological and/or psychiatric 
impairments.
Over his years of working with individuals injured in motor vehicle accidents, Mr. Ferland
developed a strong interest in the field of mental health, focussed on functional reactivation for 
injured individuals suffering from depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. His clinical 
acumen has led him to be qualified as an Expert in his field by the Ontario Superior Court of 
Justice. 
PURPOSE OF REFERRAL:
This therapist received a request from the offices of McNally Gervan law firm to complete an 
updated In-Home Assessment to assist in the completion of a Life Care Plan by Ms. Kathy Nezan 
of Modern OT. This assessment was completed on November 23, 2021 in Mr. Al Naqeeb's home, 
following his completion of a workday. 
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
Mr. Al Naqeeb is a 35-year-old man who was involved in a significant motor vehicle accident on 
August 27, 2013 when his vehicle was rear-ended at a high rate of speed. As a result of this 
accident, Mr. Al Naqeeb sustained a number of physical injuries and went on to develop a complex 
psychiatric presentation coupled with persistent cognitive impairments associated with a traumatic 
brain injury. 
At the time of this assessment, Mr. Al Naqeeb indicated that he continues to struggle with most 
aspects of daily function. He remains vocationally engaged, against medical advice, working as a 
National Property Manager with Natural Resources Canada, administering $750 million dollars of 
government property. By all accounts, Mr. Al Naqeeb appears at this time to not be performing 
his duties effectively and struggling to get through a workday. He is currently working from home 
and has been found to be a deshevelled state on the day of this assessment. He noted that he rarely 
showers (often only every 10 to 14 days), brushes his teeth once every two weeks and will wear 
the same clothes and socks for 4 – 5 days. He notes that his mental health has been poor and that 
his contribution to the operation of his home is minimal. This has led to significant struggles in 
his marriage leading to a separation in or around 2019. Mr. Al Naqeeb is currently back in the 
family home noting that he and his wife are attempting to reconcile their marriage. He has noted 
that his wife is exasperated with his inability to contribute to maintaining the home and looking 
after their two children. Mr. Al Naqeeb spends most of his time in the home loft sitting at his 
computer desk or napping on the adjacent sofa. 
Mr. Al Naqeeb has been resistant to input from medical and para-medical providers, opting to 
ignore the severity of his limitations and instead "pushing through" and continuing to work as best 
he can. He noted that in his culture, men are expected to "get it done" despite how they are feeling. 
He highlighted the primary function of a man to be the provider to his wife and children, and this 
comes above all else. 
At work, he notes significant difficulties with communicating effectively with co-workers. He 
requires significant amounts of preparation time before presentations. He noted that he has been 
found to make numerous mistakes in his work and having to work extra hours to keep up with the 
demands of his job. He noted a pattern of seeking "easier" jobs in an effort to remain gainfully 
employed and despite this, is struggling to get through a workday. In this therapist's professional 
opinion, the current situation is unsustainable, and it is most likely that Mr. Al Naqeeb will at some 
point require a medical leave of indeterminate duration. 
RECOMMENDATIONS:
Attendant Care:
Mr. Al Naqeeb is found to be deteriorating in contrast with the assessment completed by this 
therapist in 2014. He is simply not completing core self-care functions and not looking after 
himself effectively. Mr. Al Naqeeb would benefit from Attendant Care for cueing to support his 
completion of self-care tasks such as showering, grooming, and wearing clean clothes. A Form 1 
has been completed to reflect his current needs and he is found to require 8.35 hours per week of 
Attendant Care for a total of $550.30 per month of assessed Attendant Care Benefit.
Housekeeping:
Mr. Al Naqeeb is currently not performing any of his pre-accident housekeeping and home 
maintenance responsibilities. His wife has and continues to look after the upkeep of the home as 
well as providing care for their two young children. His wife is currently deploying an additional, 
estimated 10.83 hours per week of housework to account for Mr. Al Naqeeb's share of 
responsibilities.
Assistive Devices:
There are no assistive devices currently indicated to foster improvements in Mr. Al Naqeeb's daily 
function.
Further Occupational Therapy Interventions:
Mr. Al Naqeeb would benefit from resumption of Occupational Therapy treatment to assist him in 
improving the quality of his self-care and foster engagement in meaningful activity. His 
deteriorating mental health is of great concern and the lack of professional support is a significant 
issue at this time. An initial course of 12 bi-weekly treatment sessions is proposed with the 
anticipation that long-term treatment may be required pending a demonstrated level of engagement 
on his behalf.
Referral for Other Services:
Mr. Al Naqeeb would benefit from the introduction of the following treatments to support him in 
this difficult time:
• Psychology; he would benefit from engagement in regular counselling sessions with a 
clinical psychologist to assist in reframing unhealthy and ditorted thinking and to develop 
healthier coping strategies to manage his symptoms.
• Speech Language Pathology; given the presence of a traumatic brain injury and reports of 
difficulties in communication and word finding, the introduction of SLP is found to be 
crucial at this time.
• Physical Therapy; given his ongoing reports of physical pain, Mr. Al Naqeeb would 
benefit from engagement in physical therapy (such as physiotherapy, chiropractic care, 
massage therapy) in order to better manage his physical pain and increase his level of 
physical activity.
• Kinesiology; given his lack of physical activity and his high levels of anxiety, the 
introduction of a prescribed exercise regimen overseen by a kinesiologist would be greatly 
beneficial. He would benefit from engagement in two, one-hour sessions of exercise per 
week to support his physical and emotional recovery.
