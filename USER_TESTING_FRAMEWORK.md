## Testing Methodology

### 1. Participant Selection

- **Target Group**: Occupational Therapists (OTs) with varying experience levels
  - 3-5 novice OTs (0-2 years experience)
  - 3-5 experienced OTs (3+ years experience)
  - 2-3 OT supervisors/managers who review reports

- **Selection Criteria**:
  - Experience with assessment report writing
  - Varied comfort levels with technology
  - Representation from different practice settings (hospitals, clinics, home health)

### 2. Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Complete Assessment Using Intelligence Features
Participants will be asked to complete a full assessment using the intelligence features as guidance.

**Tasks**:
- Create a new assessment for a hypothetical client
- Complete each section of the assessment
- Review and act on intelligence suggestions
- Generate a final report

**Metrics**:
- Time to complete assessment
- Number of intelligence suggestions followed
- Quality of final report (evaluated by expert reviewer)
- Number of errors/omissions in final report

#### Scenario 2: Review and Improve Existing Assessment
Participants will be given a partially completed assessment with deliberate issues to test how well the intelligence features identify problems.

**Tasks**:
- Review an existing assessment
- Identify and resolve issues using intelligence features
- Rate the helpfulness of each intelligence feature
- Document any missing suggestions that should have been identified

**Metrics**:
- Number of issues correctly identified using intelligence features
- Number of issues missed by intelligence features
- Time spent reviewing and correcting assessment
- User satisfaction with each intelligence feature

#### Scenario 3: Real-World Usage
Participants will use the system in their actual work environment for 1-2 weeks.

**Tasks**:
- Integrate Delilah V3.0 into daily workflow
- Document experiences, challenges, and benefits
- Participate in follow-up interview

**Metrics**:
- Frequency of feature usage
- Self-reported efficiency gains
- Integration challenges
- Overall satisfaction

### 3. Data Collection Methods

#### Quantitative Methods:
- **System Usage Analytics**:
  - Feature usage frequency
  - Time spent on each section
  - Error rates
  - Intelligence feature acceptance rates

- **Structured Surveys**:
  - System Usability Scale (SUS)
  - Feature-specific satisfaction ratings (1-5 scale)
  - Comparative assessment (vs. previous workflow)

#### Qualitative Methods:
- **Think-Aloud Sessions**:
  - Participants verbalize thoughts while completing tasks
  - Facilitator observes and documents insights

- **Semi-Structured Interviews**:
  - Pre-test background and expectations
  - Post-test experience and feedback
  - Specific questions about intelligence features

- **Feedback Journal**:
  - Participants document thoughts during extended usage
  - Specific prompts for intelligence feature feedback

### 4. Testing Environment

#### Controlled Environment Testing:
- Quiet, dedicated testing space
- Standardized equipment and network conditions
- Screen and audio recording
- Facilitator present for observation and assistance

#### Field Testing:
- Participants' actual work environments
- Various devices and network conditions
- Self-documented experiences
- Remote support available

## Testing Schedule

1. **Preparation Phase** (1 week):
   - Finalize testing materials and scenarios
   - Recruit participants
   - Set up testing environment and tools

2. **Controlled Testing Phase** (2 weeks):
   - Conduct in-person testing sessions (2-3 hours each)
   - Record sessions and collect immediate feedback
   - Make rapid adjustments for critical issues

3. **Field Testing Phase** (2 weeks):
   - Deploy to participants' work environments
   - Collect ongoing feedback
   - Provide remote support

4. **Analysis Phase** (1 week):
   - Compile and analyze results
   - Identify patterns and priorities
   - Prepare recommendations report

## Feedback Analysis Framework

### 1. Categorization
Feedback will be categorized into:
- **Usability Issues**: Interface problems, confusing workflows
- **Feature Requests**: Missing functionality or enhancements
- **Intelligence Accuracy**: False positives/negatives in suggestions
- **Performance Issues**: Speed, resource usage, reliability
- **Content Quality**: Helpfulness and clarity of suggestions
- **Compliance Concerns**: Regulatory or standard adherence issues

### 2. Prioritization
Issues will be prioritized based on:
- **Frequency**: Number of users experiencing the issue
- **Severity**: Impact on workflow and outcomes
- **Effort**: Estimated development time to address
- **Strategic Alignment**: Alignment with product vision

### 3. Action Planning
For each significant finding:
- Document specific issue or opportunity
- Define success criteria for resolution
- Assign priority level
- Estimate development effort
- Recommend implementation approach
