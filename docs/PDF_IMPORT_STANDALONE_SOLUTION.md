# PDF Import Standalone Solution

## Overview

Due to persistent loading issues with the main Delilah V3.0 application, a standalone PDF import application has been developed as an alternative solution. This application provides the core PDF import functionality and runs independently from the main application.

## Solution Details

- **Location**: D:\delilah-pdf-import
- **Port**: 3002
- **Technology**: Next.js 14.0.4
- **Dependencies**: pdfjs-dist for PDF processing

## Features Implemented

The standalone PDF import application includes:

1. **PDF Text Extraction**: Uses PDF.js to extract text content from uploaded PDF files
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Implements basic pattern matching to identify and extract patient information:
   - Name
   - Date of Birth
   - Address
   - Diagnosis

3. **User Interface**: Provides a clean, simple interface for:
   - Uploading PDF files
   - Processing and extracting information
   - Displaying extraction results
   - Previewing the extracted text

## How to Use

1. **Start the application**:
   ```
   cd D:\delilah-pdf-import
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Access the application**:
   Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3002

3. **Import a PDF**:
   - Click on "Try PDF Import" on the home page
   - Select a PDF file using the file input
   - Click "Process PDF" to extract information
   - View the extracted patient information and text preview

## Implementation Notes

This implementation is a simplified version of the PDF import feature described in the Delilah V3.0 documentation. It demonstrates the core functionality with basic pattern recognition and can be enhanced with more sophisticated features as needed.

### Code Structure

- **pages/index.js**: Home page with link to the import feature
- **pages/import/index.js**: PDF import interface and processing logic
- **utils/pdfUtils.js**: Utility functions for PDF processing:
  - `extractTextFromPdf()`: Extracts text from PDF files
  - `extractPatientInfo()`: Extracts patient information from text

### Pattern Recognition

The current implementation uses basic regular expressions to identify common patterns in medical documents:

```javascript
const namePattern = /(?:patient|name|client)(?:'s name|\sname|:)\s*([A-Za-z\s]+)(?:\r|\n|,)/i;
const dobPattern = /(?:date of birth|DOB|D\.O\.B\.?|born)(?:\son|\s|:)\s*(\d{1,2}[-/\.]\d{1,2}[-/\.]\d{2,4})/i;
const addressPattern = /(?:address|resides at|residence)(?:\s|:)\s*([A-Za-z0-9\s,\.]+)(?:\r|\n)/i;
const diagnosisPattern = /(?:diagnosis|condition|assessment|impairment)(?:\s|:)\s*([A-Za-z0-9\s,\.-]+)(?:\r|\n)/i;
```

These patterns can be enhanced with more sophisticated matching algorithms based on the specific documents being processed.

## Enhancement Opportunities

The standalone solution can be enhanced with additional features:

1. **Confidence Scoring**: Implement a scoring system to indicate the reliability of extracted information
2. **Additional Data Fields**: Add recognition for more medical information fields
3. **Section Detection**: Implement section detection to organize extracted information by document section
4. **Preview Enhancement**: Add visual highlighting of matched patterns in the text preview
5. **Data Integration**: Add ability to export or save extracted data for use in assessment workflows

## Comparison with Main Application

This standalone implementation provides the core PDF import functionality while avoiding the complex routing and context structure of the main application. It serves as both a temporary solution and a testbed for enhancements to the PDF processing capabilities.
