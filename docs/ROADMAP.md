# Development Roadmap (Updated Feb 2025)

## Current Status
Demographics section test coverage has been improved with:
- ✅ Component Unit Tests (Personal, Legal)
- ✅ Integration Tests (Demographics Section)
- ⚠️ One failing E2E test remaining (Tab Panel Visibility)
- ✅ Test Factory Pattern implemented

## Immediate Priority Tasks

### 1. Fix Remaining E2E Test
```typescript
// Current failing test in demographics.test.tsx
it('shows correct active tab panel', async () => {
  // Tab panel visibility test needs fixing
});
```

### 2. Component Test Coverage
- Insurance Component Tests
- Contact Component Tests
- Display Component Tests
- Cross-component Integration Tests

### 3. Test Infrastructure
- Standardize form test patterns
- Complete test factory implementation
- Add accessibility testing patterns
- Improve mock reusability

### 4. Documentation Updates
- Update test documentation
- Document form test patterns
- Add component test examples
- Create testing cheat sheet

## Next Development Phase

### 1. Form Component Testing
- [ ] Complete test coverage for all form components
- [ ] Standardize form validation testing
- [ ] Document form testing patterns
- [ ] Create form test helpers

### 2. Integration Testing
- [ ] Cross-component state management
- [ ] Form data persistence
- [ ] Error handling scenarios
- [ ] Mode switching (Edit/View)

### 3. Accessibility Testing
- [ ] ARIA label testing
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility
- [ ] Form validation announcements

### 4. Performance Testing
- [ ] Form rendering benchmarks
- [ ] State update performance
- [ ] Data persistence metrics
- [ ] Load time optimization

## Success Metrics
1. 100% test coverage for critical paths
2. Zero failing tests in CI/CD pipeline
3. All components follow test factory pattern
4. Full accessibility compliance
5. Documented test patterns for all components

## Development Notes
1. Use test factory pattern for all new components
2. Follow established naming conventions
3. Write tests before implementation
4. Document all testing patterns
5. Include accessibility tests by default

## Testing Priority Matrix

High Priority / High Impact:
- Form validation
- Data persistence
- Error handling
- Accessibility

Medium Priority:
- Performance metrics
- Edge cases
- Browser compatibility
- Mobile responsiveness

Low Priority:
- Visual regression
- Animation testing
- Stress testing
- Load testing

## Next Steps

1. Immediate:
   - Fix tab panel visibility test
   - Complete Insurance component tests
   - Update test documentation

2. Short Term:
   - Implement remaining component tests
   - Standardize test patterns
   - Add accessibility tests

3. Long Term:
   - Complete E2E test suite
   - Performance optimization
   - Testing automation
