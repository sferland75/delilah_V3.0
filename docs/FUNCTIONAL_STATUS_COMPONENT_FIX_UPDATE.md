# Functional Status Component Fix - Update (March 5, 2025)

## Issue Resolution

The Functional Status section was experiencing rendering errors with the "Element type is invalid" error. This has been resolved by implementing a complete rewrite of the RangeOfMotion component.

## Implementation Details

1. **Direct Component Implementation**: 
   - Rewrote `RangeOfMotion.tsx` as a self-contained component without dependencies on SimpleRangeOfMotion
   - Added both named and default exports to support all import patterns
   - Enhanced error handling with comprehensive try/catch blocks

2. **Form Structure Improvements**:
   - Fixed DOM nesting issues by using div containers instead of nested form elements
   - Implemented Button with explicit onClick handlers for form submission
   - Properly handled React Hook Form props to eliminate warnings

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Added robust error handling for form context access
   - Implemented safe property access throughout the component
   - Added meaningful error UI for various failure scenarios

## Testing Status

The component has been successfully refactored and can now:
- Render without errors 
- Handle form inputs correctly
- Submit data as expected

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar patterns to other form components in the application
2. Address remaining DOM nesting warnings in Demographics component
3. Implement consistent form handling pattern across all assessment sections
