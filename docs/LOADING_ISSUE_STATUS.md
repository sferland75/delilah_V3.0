# Delilah V3.0 Application Loading Issue Status

## Current Status

As of March 3, 2025, the Delilah V3.0 application is experiencing persistent loading issues despite multiple troubleshooting attempts. The application starts properly but encounters a redirection loop when accessing it through the browser.

## Environment

- Next.js 14.0.4
- Custom Babel configuration (using .babelrc)
- Windows environment
- Port: 3000

## Symptoms

- Server starts successfully with message: "âœ“ Ready in 12.3s"
- Browser shows: "This page isn't working - localhost redirected you too many times."
- Error code: ERR_TOO_MANY_REDIRECTS

## Verification Steps Completed

1. Verified all components exist and are properly structured
2. Confirmed that the application server starts without errors
3. Confirmed that the compilation process completes successfully
4. Verified that both Pages Router and App Router files are present and correctly formatted
5. Created a working minimal PDF import application (separate project) that functions properly

## Troubleshooting Steps Performed

1. Restored original configuration files:
   - Restored the original index.tsx file
   - Restored the original _app.js file
   - Restored the original .babelrc configuration
   - Restored the original next.config.js file
   - Restored the PDF.js configuration

2. Removed temporary debug files created during troubleshooting

3. Cleaned build cache:
   - Deleted the .next directory to force a clean build

4. Reinstalled dependencies:
   - Ran npm install to ensure all dependencies are correctly installed

5. System-level troubleshooting:
   - Rebooted the PC to clear any system-level caches or locked ports
   - Cleared browser cookies for localhost:3000
   - Tried accessing the application in incognito/private browsing mode

6. Alternative approach:
   - Successfully created a separate, minimal application (delilah-pdf-import) that implements the PDF import functionality correctly

7. Additional troubleshooting (unsuccessful):
   - Tried accessing with IP address (127.0.0.1:3000) instead of localhost
   - Tried using different ports (3001, etc.)
   - Simplified the Babel configuration to use only the Next.js preset (removed custom presets)

## Current Hypothesis

The application appears to be caught in a redirection loop, which could be caused by:

1. **Conflicting routing configurations**: There may be conflicts between the Pages Router and App Router configurations that are causing circular redirects.

2. **Middleware issues**: There could be middleware or server-side code that's triggering redirects.

3. **Framework incompatibility**: There might be incompatibilities between the versions of various packages or frameworks used in the application.

4. **Deep-rooted configuration issue**: Since changing the Babel configuration didn't help, the issue might be related to a more fundamental aspect of the project's setup.

## Next Steps

1. **Network debugging**: Use browser developer tools to capture the network traffic and identify the exact redirect chain.

2. **Incremental restoration**: Start with a minimal working app and gradually add components until the issue appears.

3. **Production build test**: Try a production build to see if the issue persists:
   ```
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

4. **Move to standalone solution**: Consider porting more functionality to the working standalone application (delilah-pdf-import) while troubleshooting the main application issues.

5. **Deep configuration review**: Conduct a more thorough review of all configuration files, including package.json, for any unusual settings.

## Workaround

Until the main application issue is resolved, we have successfully created a standalone PDF import application (delilah-pdf-import) that provides the essential PDF import functionality. This application runs on port 3002 and can be used as a temporary solution.
