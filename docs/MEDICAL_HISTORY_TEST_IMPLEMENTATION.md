# Medical History Test Implementation

This document provides an overview of the test implementation for the Medical History section of the Delilah V3.0 application. These tests focus on the Medical History component, the mapper service, and the integration with the Assessment Context.

## Test Files Implemented

1. **Medical History Mapper Service Tests**
   - File: `src/services/__tests__/medicalHistoryMapper.test.ts`
   - Purpose: Tests the bidirectional mapping functionality between context data and form data structures.
   - Coverage: Tests all mapper functions including:
     - `mapContextToForm`
     - `mapFormToContext`
     - `exportMedicalHistoryToJson`
     - `importMedicalHistoryFromJson`

2. **Medical History Integrated Component Tests**
   - File: `src/sections/3-MedicalHistory/__tests__/MedicalHistory.integrated.test.tsx`
   - Purpose: Tests the MedicalHistoryIntegrated component that uses the mapper service to integrate with the Assessment Context.
   - Coverage: Tests component rendering, tab navigation, context data loading, form submission, and export/import functionality.

3. **Standardized Tabs Tests**
   - File: `src/sections/3-MedicalHistory/__tests__/StandardizedTabs.test.tsx`
   - Purpose: Tests the standardized tab component implementation in the Medical History section.
   - Coverage: Tests tab styling, tab navigation, accessibility, and content display.

4. **Assessment Context Integration Tests**
   - File: `src/test/assessment-context-integration/MedicalHistoryIntegration.test.tsx`
   - Purpose: Tests the integration between the Medical History section and the Assessment Context provider.
   - Coverage: Tests data flow between context and component, preservation of existing context data, and UI updates reflecting context changes.

## Test Execution

Two batch files have been created to run the tests:

1. **Medical History Tests Only**
   - File: `run_medical_history_tests.bat`
   - Purpose: Runs only the Medical History related tests.
   - Usage: Execute this script to run all Medical History tests in sequence.

2. **All Tests Including Medical History**
   - File: `run_tests.bat` (updated)
   - Purpose: Runs all tests including the new Medical History tests.
   - Usage: Execute this script to run all tests in the application.

## Test Approach

The tests follow these key principles:

### 1. Isolated Component Testing
- All components are tested in isolation with appropriate mocks for dependencies.
- Form state, context integration, and tab navigation are tested separately.

### 2. Comprehensive Mapper Testing
- Mapper functions are tested with various data scenarios.
- Tests handle both valid and malformed data.
- Bidirectional mapping consistency is verified.

### 3. Standardized UI Testing
- Tests focus on the standardized tab pattern.
- Styling classes and accessibility attributes are verified.
- Tab navigation flow is thoroughly tested.

### 4. Integration Testing
- Real AssessmentProvider is used to test integration.
- Data flow between context and component is verified.
- Full end-to-end functionality is tested.

## Coverage

These tests focus on the following aspects of coverage:

1. **Statement Coverage**
   - Tests cover all code paths in the mapper service.
   - Component rendering and lifecycle methods are verified.
   - All UI interactions are tested.

2. **Branch Coverage**
   - Error handling branches are tested with invalid inputs.
   - Conditional rendering based on context data is verified.
   - Tab selection and visibility conditions are tested.

3. **Functionality Coverage**
   - Data loading from context to form
   - Form submission to context
   - Tab navigation
   - Form reset
   - Data export/import

## Next Steps

Building on these tests, the next steps for test coverage should focus on:

1. Extending the same test patterns to other sections
2. Creating cross-section integration tests
3. Testing export to PDF and Word formats
4. Adding end-to-end tests with Cypress or similar tools

This implementation serves as a template for testing other sections of the application following the same patterns and principles.
