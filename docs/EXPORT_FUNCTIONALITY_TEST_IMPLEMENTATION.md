# Export Functionality Test Implementation

This document provides an overview of the test implementation for the Export Functionality of the Delilah V3.0 application. These tests focus on the Export Service and UI components that handle exporting reports to different formats, email sharing, and print optimization.

## Test Files Implemented

1. **Export Service Tests**
   - File: `src/services/export/__tests__/export-service.test.ts`
   - Purpose: Tests the core export service functionality including PDF and Word export methods.
   - Coverage: Tests the following methods:
     - `exportReport` - The main method for exporting to different formats
     - `exportToPdf` - PDF generation with various options
     - `exportToWord` - Word document generation with various options
     - `exportToClientRecord` - Client record system integration

2. **Email Sharing Tests**
   - File: `src/services/export/__tests__/email-sharing.test.ts`
   - Purpose: Tests the email sharing functionality of the export service.
   - Coverage: Tests the `shareViaEmail` method with various configurations including:
     - Recipient validation
     - PDF attachment generation
     - Word attachment generation
     - Combined PDF and Word attachments
     - Default and custom email subjects/bodies
     - Error handling during attachment generation

3. **Print Optimization Tests**
   - File: `src/services/export/__tests__/print-optimization.test.ts`
   - Purpose: Tests the generation of print-optimized versions of reports.
   - Coverage: Tests the `generatePrintVersion` method with focus on:
     - Print-specific configuration options (margins, headers, footers)
     - Preservation of user-specified options
     - Organization branding options
     - Error handling during PDF generation

4. **Export UI Component Tests**
   - File: `src/components/ReportDrafting/__tests__/ExportOptions.test.tsx`
   - Purpose: Tests the UI components for configuring and triggering export operations.
   - Coverage: Tests the `ExportTabContent` component for:
     - Tab navigation between File, Email, and Print options
     - Form field updates and validation
     - Export button functionality
     - Email sending functionality
     - Print functionality
     - Loading states and error handling

## Test Execution

Two batch files have been created to run the tests:

1. **Export Functionality Tests Only**
   - File: `run_export_tests.bat`
   - Purpose: Runs only the export functionality related tests.
   - Usage: Execute this script to run all export tests in sequence.

2. **All Tests Including Export Functionality**
   - File: `run_tests.bat` (updated)
   - Purpose: Runs all tests including the new export functionality tests.
   - Usage: Execute this script to run all tests in the application.

## Test Approach

The tests follow these key principles:

### 1. Comprehensive Mocking

- **External Libraries**: All external libraries (jsPDF, docx, file-saver) are thoroughly mocked to isolate the export service functionality.
- **Complex Objects**: PDF and Word documents are mocked to allow verification of method calls without actual document generation.
- **File System**: File saving operations are mocked to avoid actual file creation during tests.

### 2. Option Variations

- Tests cover various combinations of export options to ensure all options are respected.
- Special attention to options that affect document structure, security, and appearance.
- Tests verify that defaults are applied correctly when options are omitted.

### 3. Error Handling

- Tests verify that errors in each stage of the export process are properly caught and reported.
- Error cases for PDF generation, Word generation, and email sending are covered.
- Ensures failed exports provide meaningful error messages.

### 4. UI Integration

- Tests verify that UI components correctly interact with the export service.
- Form fields correctly update export options.
- Loading states are handled properly during export operations.
- Success and error messages are displayed appropriately.

## Coverage

These tests focus on the following aspects of coverage:

1. **Functional Coverage**
   - PDF export with various options
   - Word document export with various options
   - Email sharing with different attachment configurations
   - Print optimization
   - Client record system integration

2. **Code Coverage**
   - Methods and conditionals in the export service
   - Form fields and buttons in the UI components
   - Error handling paths
   - Default value application

3. **Option Coverage**
   - Document properties and metadata
   - Security options (password protection, permissions)
   - Layout options (page size, orientation, margins)
   - Content options (headers, footers, table of contents)
   - Branding options (organization name, logo)

## Test Patterns

1. **Service Method Testing**
   - Verify method calls with correct parameters
   - Check result object structure and values
   - Verify file blob creation and saving
   - Test error handling

2. **Option Processing Testing**
   - Verify default options are applied when not specified
   - Test option combinations and interactions
   - Ensure user-specified options take precedence

3. **UI Component Testing**
   - Test form field updates
   - Verify tab navigation
   - Test button click handlers
   - Check loading state management

4. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Force errors in PDF generation
   - Force errors in Word generation
   - Test missing required fields (email recipients)
   - Verify error message display

## Next Steps

Building on these tests, the next steps for test coverage could focus on:

1. Integration testing with actual report data from the assessment context
2. Testing with more complex report structures (larger reports, custom sections)
3. Accessibility testing for the export UI components
4. End-to-end testing of the complete export workflow

## Dependencies

These tests rely on mocking the following dependencies:

- jsPDF and jspdf-autotable for PDF generation
- docx for Word document generation
- file-saver for file download functionality

The mocks are designed to verify method calls and parameters without actually generating documents, which allows for faster and more reliable tests.
