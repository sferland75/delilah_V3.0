# FormField Component Fix

## Issue
Components importing `FormField` from '@/components/ui/form' were experiencing errors because this component was not defined or exported from that file. This caused React rendering errors with the message:

```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

## Resolution
1. Created a new component file at `src/components/ui/form-field.tsx` that implements the `FormField` component.
2. Updated all form components to import `FormField` from '@/components/ui/form-field' instead of '@/components/ui/form'.

### Components Updated:
- `src/sections/1-InitialAssessment/components/Personal.tsx`
- `src/sections/1-InitialAssessment/components/Contact.tsx`
- `src/sections/1-InitialAssessment/components/Insurance.tsx`
- `src/sections/1-InitialAssessment/components/Legal.tsx`
- `src/sections/2-PurposeAndMethodology/components/ReferralInfoSection.tsx`
- `src/sections/2-PurposeAndMethodology/components/AssessmentObjectivesSection.tsx`
- `src/sections/2-PurposeAndMethodology/components/MethodologySection.tsx`
- `src/sections/2-PurposeAndMethodology/components/AdditionalRequirementsSection.tsx`
- `src/sections/4-SymptomsAssessment/components/PhysicalSymptomsSection.updated.tsx`
- `src/sections/4-SymptomsAssessment/components/CognitiveSymptomsSection.updated.tsx`
- `src/sections/4-SymptomsAssessment/components/EmotionalSymptomsSection.tsx`

### FormField Implementation
The newly created FormField component is essentially a wrapper around react-hook-form's Controller component:

```typescript
// src/components/ui/form-field.tsx
"use client"

import React from "react";
import { Controller, useFormContext } from "react-hook-form";

type FormFieldProps = {
  name: string;
  control?: any;
  render: (props: { field: any }) => React.ReactNode;
};

export const FormField = ({ name, control, render }: FormFieldProps) => {
  const formContext = useFormContext();
  const fieldControl = control || formContext?.control;

  if (!fieldControl) {
    console.error("FormField must be used within a FormProvider or be passed a control prop");
    return null;
  }

  return (
    <Controller
      name={name}
      control={fieldControl}
      render={({ field, fieldState }) => render({ field })}
    />
  );
};
```

## Notes for Developers
- This FormField component should be considered part of the form component library.
- When adding new form components, make sure to import FormField from '@/components/ui/form-field'
- If shadcn or other UI libraries are updated, ensure this component remains compatible.
- This fix addresses issues across multiple sections of the application including Demographics, Purpose and Methodology, and Symptoms Assessment.
- All form components should now use this implementation to maintain consistency across the application.
