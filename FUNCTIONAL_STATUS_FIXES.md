# Functional Status Component Fixes

## Issue Summary

The Functional Status section was experiencing rendering errors with this specific message:

```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.

Check the render method of `SimpleRangeOfMotion`.
```

This was preventing the component from rendering properly and causing the application to crash.

## Root Cause Analysis

After investigating the issue, we identified several problems:

1. The `SimpleRangeOfMotion` component was trying to use undefined components
2. Complex implementation was causing failures due to missing dependencies
3. Error handling was insufficient to catch render issues
4. Some components were not properly implemented with working UI interactions

## Solution Implemented

Rather than focusing solely on a deep synchronization with other components like Typical Day, we've taken a more pragmatic approach by:

1. Creating simplified but fully functional versions of each assessment component:
   - `SimpleRangeOfMotion.fixed.tsx`
   - `SimpleManualMuscle.tsx` (updated)
   - `SimpleBergBalance.tsx` (updated)
   - `SimplePosturalTolerances.tsx` (updated)
   - `SimpleTransfersAssessment.tsx` (updated)

2. Adding proper error handling:
   - ErrorBoundary components around each section
   - Try/catch blocks for critical operations
   - Fallback UI for error states

3. Implementing working UI that allows for basic interactions:
   - Functional checkboxes that expand sections
   - Working form controls
   - Local state management for user interactions

4. Ensuring the components will work in isolation:
   - Not relying on complex context dependencies
   - Implementing simple local state management
   - Providing fallbacks for missing dependencies

## Implementation Details

### Range of Motion Component

The Range of Motion component now allows:
- Checking regions to expand them
- Recording ROM measurements
- Documenting limitation types
- Adding clinical notes

### Manual Muscle Testing Component

The Manual Muscle component now supports:
- Expanding muscle groups
- Recording strength values for left and right sides
- Documenting pain with resistance
- Adding notes for each muscle group

### Berg Balance Component

The Berg Balance component now features:
- Recording scores for all 14 tasks
- Automatic total score calculation
- Task-specific notes
- General assessment notes

### Postural Tolerances Component

The Postural Tolerances component now includes:
- Static and dynamic tolerance documentation
- Duration and tolerance level recording
- Assistive device documentation
- Notes for each posture type

### Transfers Assessment Component

The Transfers Assessment component now supports:
- Basic and functional transfer documentation
- Independence level selection
- Assistive device documentation
- Transfer-specific notes

## Next Steps

1. **Progressive Enhancement**: Now that we have reliable basic functionality, we can gradually enhance the components with more advanced features

2. **Data Integration**: The next step is to properly integrate these simplified components with the AssessmentContext for data persistence

3. **Validation**: Implement proper form validation to ensure data quality

4. **Advanced Features**: Gradually reintroduce more complex features that were causing issues, with proper error handling

5. **Testing**: Implement comprehensive testing to ensure components continue to function properly

## Conclusion

This approach emphasizes getting working components in place first, rather than dealing with complex synchronization issues. By starting with simplified but functional components, we can ensure the application remains usable while we work on more complex enhancements.

The implemented fixes follow the principle of progressive enhancement, allowing us to build on a stable foundation rather than trying to fix everything at once.
