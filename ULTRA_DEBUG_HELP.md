# Ultra Debug Assessment Context

This tool provides an ultra-enhanced debugging version of the AssessmentContext that:

1. **Adds extremely detailed console logging**
2. **Auto-detects and fixes nested data structure issues**
3. **Provides special debug-only pages to see the raw data**

## Problem Symptoms

You're experiencing issues where data seems to be loaded but not appearing in the forms. This typically happens with:

- Medical History
- Emotional Symptoms
- Typical Day

## Quick Start

```bash
# Apply the ultra debug version
d:\delilah_V3.0\apply-ultra-debug.bat

# Restart your app server

# When done, restore the original:
d:\delilah_V3.0\restore-context-orig.bat
```

## Special Debug Pages

These pages show exactly what data is in the context:

- `/assessment/context-debug` - Shows entire context
- `/assessment/medical-fixed` - Shows raw Medical History data
- `/assessment/symptoms-fixed` - Shows raw Symptoms Assessment data
- `/assessment/typical-day-fixed` - Shows raw Typical Day data

## Common Problems & Solutions

### 1. Double-Nested Data

A common issue is that data gets double-nested, e.g.:
```javascript
typicalDay: {
  typicalDay: {
    // The actual data
  }
}
```

The ultra debug context automatically detects and fixes this.

### 2. Incorrect Access Patterns

Components might be trying to access data with the wrong path:

```javascript
// WRONG
data.typicalDay.typicalDay.morningRoutine

// CORRECT
data.typicalDay.morningRoutine
```

The ultra debug logs will show the correct paths.

### 3. Empty Objects

Even if data appears to be loaded, it might be empty objects:

```javascript
// Looks valid in logs, but actually empty
data.medicalHistory: {} 
```

The ultra debug will show the deep content and exact properties.

## How to Debug

1. Apply the ultra debug context
2. Load a sample case
3. Check the console logs for "*** ULTRA DEBUG ***" messages
4. Visit the special debug pages to see the raw data
5. Compare what's in the context to what your components are trying to access

After identifying the problem, you can restore the original context and fix the specific components with the knowledge gained.

## Auto-Fixing Feature

The ultra debug context will automatically fix these issues:

- Double-nested data (e.g., `typicalDay.typicalDay`)
- Section-name mismatches during updates

These fixes will appear in the console logs with "*** ULTRA DEBUG *** Fixing..." messages.
