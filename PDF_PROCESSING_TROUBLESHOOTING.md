# PDF Processing Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue: Import Process Stuck at 40%

If the PDF import process gets stuck at 40%, this typically indicates an issue with PDF.js when trying to extract text from the document. The 40% mark occurs right after the PDF document is loaded but before page extraction begins.

## Quick Fixes

1. **Try the Enhanced Import Page**
   
   I've updated the assessment.tsx file with improved error handling, timeout protection, and better debugging. Try using this updated version.

2. **Use the PDF Debug Tool**
   
   I've created a PDF.js debugging tool that can help identify specific issues with your PDF. Access it at:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/testing/pdf-debug
   ```

3. **Check Console for Errors**
   
   Look for error messages in the browser console that might provide more specific information about the failure.

## Common Causes and Solutions

### 1. PDF.js Worker Not Properly Loaded

**Symptom:**
- Process stops at exactly 40%
- Console shows errors about PDF.js worker

**Solution:**
- Ensure `/public/pdf.worker.js` exists
- Make sure the PDF.js worker is properly configured in your application startup

### 2. Protected or Encrypted PDF

**Symptom:**
- Process stops at 40%
- Console may show errors about permissions or encryption

**Solution:**
- Try a different PDF that doesn't have encryption or password protection
- If it's a scanned PDF, it might not contain extractable text

### 3. Large or Complex PDF

**Symptom:**
- Process seems to hang at 40% but may eventually continue if left long enough
- The browser may become unresponsive

**Solution:**
- Try a smaller PDF file
- Use the enhanced version of assessment.tsx which includes timeout protection
- If you must process large PDFs, consider using a worker thread implementation

### 4. PDF.js Version Issues

**Symptom:**
- Process stops at 40%
- Console shows compatibility errors

**Solution:**
- Ensure the PDF.js version (2.16.105) is correctly installed
- Verify the PDF.js worker version matches the main library

## Testing with the PDF Debug Tool

The PDF debug tool provides detailed logging of the PDF processing steps to help identify where the process is failing:

1. Select a PDF file using the tool
2. Click "Process PDF"
3. Watch the logs to see exactly where the process fails
4. If text extraction succeeds in the debug tool but fails in the main application, it may indicate an issue with the integration

## Special Case: Issue with Specific PDF Format

If the issue only occurs with specific PDFs, it could be due to:

1. **Custom Font Issues**: Some PDFs use custom fonts that PDF.js struggles to extract text from
2. **Strange PDF Structure**: Some PDF creation tools produce non-standard PDFs that confuse PDF.js
3. **Image-based PDFs**: PDFs created from scanned documents don't contain text data

## Solutions for Production

For a production application, consider these more robust solutions:

1. **Server-side Processing**: Process PDFs on the server using a more robust PDF processing library
2. **Worker Thread Implementation**: Move PDF processing to a worker thread to prevent UI freezing
3. **Progress Granularity**: Add more detailed progress indicators to help identify exactly where failures occur
4. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implement OCR or other fallback mechanisms for problematic PDFs

## Code Updates Made

The updated assessment.tsx includes:

1. **Timeout Protection**: Prevents indefinite hanging
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Provides more detailed error messages
3. **Cancellation Support**: Allows users to cancel processing
4. **Per-Page Processing**: Continues even if individual pages fail
5. **Detailed Console Logging**: Helps track down issues

## If All Else Fails

If you continue to experience issues with PDF processing, consider:

1. **Alternative PDF Tools**: Try a different PDF processing library
2. **Backend Processing**: Move PDF processing to a backend service
3. **Simplify the PDFs**: Pre-process PDFs to make them more compatible
