     - SYMPTOMSExtractor
     - DEMOGRAPHICSExtractor
     - MEDICAL_HISTORYExtractor
     - ENVIRONMENTALExtractor
     - ATTENDANT_CAREExtractor
   - Each extractor uses prioritized field extraction based on success rates
   - Added enhanced pattern matching for each section type

3. **Adaptive Pattern Selection**

   - Added strategy selection based on document type and structure
   - Created context-aware pattern matching

4. **Visualization Dashboard**
   - Implemented dashboard for monitoring pattern effectiveness
   - Added visualizations for section confidence and field extraction success
   - Created statistical reports on pattern performance

### Next Steps for Pattern Recognition (March 4-6, 2025)

1. **Remaining Section-Specific Extractors** (March 4, 2025)
   - Create FUNCTIONAL_STATUSExtractor with mobility and transfer patterns
   - Implement TYPICAL_DAYExtractor with routine detection
   - Develop ADLSExtractor with activity recognition

2. **Performance Optimization** (March 5, 2025)
   - Implement parallel processing with worker threads
   - Create incremental processing for large documents
   - Add caching system for pattern matching results

3. **Documentation and Testing** (March 6, 2025)
   - Document pattern recognition best practices
   - Create comprehensive test suite
   - Generate performance benchmarks
   - Finalize implementation report

### Technical Implementation Details

The implementation follows a modular architecture:

- `PatternMatcher.js` - Generated from analysis data with statistical patterns
- `patterns/BaseExtractor.js` - Base class for all extractors with common functionality
- `patterns/[SECTION]Extractor.js` - Section-specific extractors with custom logic
- `patterns/ExtractorFactory.js` - Factory for creating specialized extractors
- `patterns/ExtractorUtils.js` - Utility functions for field extraction
- `dashboard/generateDashboard.js` - Dashboard generator for visualizations
- `tests/testImplementation.js` - Test script for validation

Running the implementation:
```bash
node src/utils/pdf-import/runImplementation.js
```

This script:
1. Generates the optimized PatternMatcher
2. Creates the visualization dashboard
3. Tests the implementation with sample documents

The implementation has shown significant improvements in extraction accuracy and confidence calibration compared to the previous manual pattern matching approach.
