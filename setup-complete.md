# Pattern Recognition Integration Complete

The pattern recognition system has been integrated and is ready for testing.

## What's Been Done

1. **Fixed Pattern Recognition Issues**:
   - Updated imports in index.js for compatibility
   - Fixed error handling in the PDF processing functions
   - Added null reference checks in data mapping

2. **Created Essential Files**:
   - Added test-pdf-import.js page for pattern testing
   - Created simplified PatternMatcher.js with baseline patterns
   - Added _app.js with PDF.js configuration
   - Set up font configuration files

3. **PDF.js Integration**:
   - Configured standardFontDataUrl to fix font warnings
   - Created placeholder font files
   - Set up PDF.js worker configuration

## How to Test

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to test page**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/test-pdf-import
   ```

3. **Upload a PDF document** to test pattern recognition.

4. **Review the results**:
   - Check the confidence scores for each detected section
   - View the extracted data
   - Examine the raw text if necessary

## Next Steps

1. **Refine Pattern Matchers**:
   - Analyze more documents to improve pattern matching
   - Enhance confidence scoring based on results

2. **Improve Data Extraction**:
   - Refine extractors for better accuracy
   - Add more specific extraction patterns

3. **UI Integration**:
   - Connect pattern recognition to main application
   - Add user validation for low-confidence sections

## Known Limitations

- You may still see non-critical font warnings in the console
- Complex PDFs with unusual formatting may require additional pattern refinement
- Tables and structured data might not extract perfectly
