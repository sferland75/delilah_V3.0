OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY ASSESSMENT REPORT

CLIENT INFORMATION
Client Name: John Smith
Date of Birth: 05/15/1975
Address: 123 Main Street, Anytown, ON M1M 1M1

Previous surgeries include appendectomy (2015) and left knee arthroscopy (2018).
Current medications:
- Metformin 500mg twice daily
- Lisinopril 10mg once daily
- Tylenol Extra Strength as needed for pain
- Vitamin D 1000 IU daily

PHYSICAL SYMPTOMS
Client reports persistent neck pain rated 7/10 at worst, 4/10 at best.
Location: Bilateral cervical region with radiation to shoulders
Aggravating factors: Prolonged sitting, computer use, driving
Alleviating factors: Rest, heat, gentle stretching
Onset: Gradual following MVA on 01/15/2024

COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS
Client reports difficulty with concentration during extended tasks.
Memory issues noted, particularly with short-term recall.
Processes information more slowly than pre-injury.
Becomes mentally fatigued after 2-3 hours of cognitive effort.

PURPOSE OF ASSESSMENT
The purpose of this assessment is to evaluate the client's functional status following a motor vehicle accident on January 15, 2024, and to determine appropriate interventions and accommodations.

Assessment objectives:
- Evaluate current functional abilities and limitations
- Identify barriers to return to work
- Determine appropriate assistive devices
- Recommend suitable accommodations
- Establish rehabilitation goals

Referral questions:
1. What is the client's current functional capacity?
2. What accommodations would facilitate return to work?
3. Is the client capable of performing essential job duties?
4. What rehabilitation interventions would be most beneficial?

TYPICAL DAY
Morning:
Client wakes at 7:00 AM and experiences stiffness and pain rated 6/10. Requires 30 minutes to become mobile. Needs assistance with showering and dressing due to pain and limited range of motion. Has simple breakfast (usually cereal or toast) prepared by spouse. Takes medications at 8:00 AM.

Afternoon:
Light activities around home including short walks (10-15 minutes), reading, and watching TV. Rests frequently due to fatigue and pain. Attempts to complete light household tasks but requires multiple breaks. Pain typically increases to 7/10 by mid-afternoon.

Evening:
Pain levels typically highest (7-8/10). Spouse assists with meal preparation. Client engages in passive activities (TV, listening to audiobooks). Performs gentle stretches as recommended by physiotherapist. Takes evening medications at 9:00 PM.

Night:
Sleep is disrupted, waking 3-4 times due to pain. Uses 3 pillows to support neck and back. Reports approximately 5-6 hours of fragmented sleep.
