# LLM Prompt Engineering for Report Drafting Module

## Overview

The Report Drafting module has been enhanced with sophisticated prompt engineering to generate high-quality occupational therapy reports. This document summarizes the implementation and provides guidance for future development.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Structured Prompt Templates

We've implemented a comprehensive prompt engineering system that includes:

- **Base Prompts**: Define the AI's role as an occupational therapist with specific expertise
- **Style Variations**: Support for clinical, conversational, and simplified language styles
- **Detail Levels**: Support for brief, standard, and comprehensive detail levels
- **Section-Specific Templates**: Customized prompts for each report section
- **Professional Standards**: Integration of occupational therapy best practices
- **Evidence-Based Guidelines**: Section-specific guidance based on professional standards

### 2. Prompt Testing Framework

A robust testing framework has been developed to evaluate and improve prompt quality:

- **Automated Evaluation**: Test prompts against multiple quality criteria
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: Test all combinations of sections, styles, and detail levels
- **Edge Case Testing**: Test handling of incomplete or contradictory data
- **Report Assembly Testing**: Test full report generation with coherent integration of sections
- **Quality Metrics**: Score generated content against professional standards

### 3. Anthropic API Integration

The module now includes robust integration with the Anthropic Claude API:

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling with retries and fallbacks
- **Model Selection**: Smart selection of appropriate models based on task complexity
- **Temperature Adjustment**: Dynamic temperature settings based on section type and detail level
- **Rate Limiting Management**: Implements delays between requests to avoid rate limits
- **Fallback Content**: Provides quality backup content if API calls fail

### 4. Sample Data Structures

Sample data has been created for testing and development:

- **Realistic Test Cases**: Complete sample data for each section
- **Varying Completeness**: Test data with different levels of completeness
- **Special Case Data**: Test data for contradictory, minimal, and complex cases

## Key Files

## Usage Instructions

### Testing Prompts

To test individual prompts:
```bash
npm run test:prompt functional-status standard clinical
```

To run comprehensive test suite:
```bash
npm run test:prompt:all
```

To test full report assembly:
```bash
npm run test:prompt:report
```

### Prompt Customization

When modifying prompts:

1. Make incremental changes to existing prompts
2. Test each change thoroughly using the testing framework
3. Check generated content for professional quality
4. Evaluate against occupational therapy standards
5. Document changes in the prompt history

## Best Practices

1. **Prompt Structure**
   - Maintain the established prompt structure for consistency
   - Include role, purpose, style instructions, and section-specific content requirements
   - Provide clear guidance on professional standards

2. **Language and Tone**
   - Ensure prompts guide toward respectful, person-first language
   - Balance strength-based and deficit-focused language
   - Maintain professional documentation standards

3. **Content Requirements**
   - Specify required components for each section
   - Provide clear organization guidelines
   - Include critical reminders about professional documentation

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Test all prompt modifications with the testing framework
   - Evaluate content against professional standards
   - Get expert feedback on generated content

## Future Enhancements

1. **Expanded Section Coverage**
   - Develop prompts for additional report sections
   - Create specialized templates for different clinical scenarios

2. **Personalization**
   - Enhance client-specific language and recommendations
   - Develop prompts that adapt to client preferences

3. **Advanced Testing**
   - Implement expert review in the testing process
   - Add more sophisticated quality metrics

4. **Model Optimization**
   - Experiment with different model parameters
   - Optimize prompt-to-output efficiency

## Conclusion

The LLM prompt engineering implementation for the Report Drafting module provides a robust framework for generating high-quality occupational therapy reports. By following the established patterns and using the testing framework, the team can maintain and enhance the quality of generated content over time.

The structured approach ensures consistency across different sections while allowing appropriate variations in style and detail level. The comprehensive testing framework enables continuous improvement of prompt quality and generated content.
