# Complete Assessment Test Data

This directory contains comprehensive test data for the Delilah V3.0 assessment application. The data is organized into modular JSON files representing each section of the assessment, making it easier to maintain and update.

## File Structure

- **Complete Assessment:**
  - `complete_assessment.json` - The combined assessment data (generated by the loader script)

- **Individual Section Files:**
  - `demographics.json` - Personal and referral information
  - `medical_history.json` - Medical conditions, surgeries, and injury details
  - `symptoms_assessment.json` - Physical, cognitive, and psychological symptoms
  - `functional_status.json` - Mobility and physical function details
  - `typical_day.json` - Daily routine information
  - `environmental_assessment.json` - Home, work, and community evaluation
  - `adl_assessment.json` - Activities of daily living evaluation
  - `attendant_care.json` - Care needs and support details

- **Utility Scripts:**
  - `sample_assessment_loader.js` - Node.js script to combine section files
  - `install-dependencies.bat` - Batch script to set up dependencies

## How to Generate Complete Assessment Data

1. Run `install-dependencies.bat` to set up the Node.js environment
2. Execute `node sample_assessment_loader.js` to generate the combined `complete_assessment.json` file

## Testing Strategy

The modular approach allows for:
1. Easier updates to specific sections without modifying the entire dataset
2. Testing specific sections in isolation
3. Creating variations of test data by replacing individual section files

## Example Usage

To load the assessment data in your application:

```javascript
// Import the assessment loader
const { loadFullAssessment } = require('./sample_assessment_loader');

// Load the complete assessment data
const assessmentData = loadFullAssessment();

// Use the assessment data in your application
console.log('Patient name:', assessmentData.demographics.personalInfo.firstName);
```

## Data Overview

This test case represents a 49-year-old male patient (John Smith) who sustained injuries in a motor vehicle accident 6 weeks prior to assessment. He has multiple symptoms including neck pain, back pain, and cognitive issues that are impacting his daily function and ability to work.

## Expanding the Dataset

To add more test cases:
1. Create a new directory (e.g., `case2/`)
2. Copy and modify the section files to create a new patient profile
3. Update the loader script to support multiple case selection

## Notes for Developers

- This is comprehensive test data designed to exercise all components of the Delilah V3.0 assessment system
- The data structure matches the expected schema for the application
- All fields are populated with realistic values for thorough testing
