# Attendant Care Section Implementation

## Overview

The Attendant Care section has been implemented as part of the Delilah V3.0 project. This section allows for the assessment and calculation of attendant care needs across three levels of care.

## Key Features

1. **Multi-level Care Assessment**
   - Level 1: Routine personal care (dressing, hygiene, mobility)
   - Level 2: Basic supervision (medication management, safety monitoring)
   - Level 3: Complex care (wound care, catheter care, feeding assistance)

2. **Time and Cost Calculations**
   - Activity-based minute tracking
   - Weekly to monthly time conversion
   - Cost calculations using standard rates
   - Summary view with totals and annual projections

3. **Data Capture**
   - Detailed notes for each activity
   - Frequency and duration tracking
   - Form validation and state management

## Implementation Details

### Core Components

1. **AttendantCareSection**
   - Main container with tabbed interface
   - Manages form state and calculations
   - Provides summary dialog
   - Handles data change callbacks

2. **CareActivity**
   - Reusable component for each care activity
   - Handles input validation
   - Calculates activity totals
   - Manages notes and observations

3. **Level Components**
   - Organizes activities by category
   - Handles category expansion/collapse
   - Renders appropriate activity components

### Utils and Helpers

1. **calculations.ts**
   - `calculateTotalMinutes`: Computes minutes per week
   - `calculateWeeklyHours`: Converts minutes to hours
   - `calculateMonthlyHours`: Applies weekly-to-monthly factor
   - `calculateMonthlyCost`: Applies appropriate rate
   - `calculateSummary`: Aggregates all calculations

2. **constants.ts**
   - Care level rates
   - Category and activity definitions
   - Level descriptions
   - Conversion factors

3. **schema.ts**
   - Zod validation schema
   - Type definitions for form data

## Testing Strategy

Comprehensive testing approach with:

1. **Core Functionality Tests**
   - Component rendering
   - Input handling
   - Calculation accuracy
   - Form validation

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Cross-level interactions
   - Form state persistence
   - Calculation flow
   - Summary generation

3. **Test Coverage Goals**
   - Unit tests: 90%
   - Integration tests: 80%
   - Core functionality: 100% 

## Usage Example

```jsx
import { AttendantCareSection } from '@/sections/9-AttendantCare';

function App() {
  const handleDataChange = (data) => {
    console.log('Attendant care data updated:', data);
    // Update parent form, save to database, etc.
  };

  return (
    <AttendantCareSection 
      initialData={existingData} 
      onDataChange={handleDataChange}
    />
  );
}
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Print/Export Functionality**
   - Generate PDF reports
   - Export data for external systems

2. **Rate Customization**
   - Allow customization of rates
   - Support regional rate differences

3. **Historical Comparisons**
   - Track changes in care needs over time
   - Provide trend analysis

## Notes

The Attendant Care section is fully integrated with the form context from the parent application. All data is properly validated and calculations are performed in real-time as the user enters information.
