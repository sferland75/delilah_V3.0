# Functional Status Component Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes applied to the components in the Functional Status section to resolve undefined component errors. The primary issue was with the UI form components causing rendering errors, while the UI structural components (Accordion, Card, etc.) were working correctly.

## Components Fixed

The following components have been fixed with the hybrid approach:

1. **ManualMuscle.fixed.tsx**
2. **BergBalance.fixed.tsx**
3. **PosturalTolerances.fixed.tsx**
4. **TransfersAssessment.fixed.tsx**
5. **FunctionalStatus.integrated.fixed.tsx** (Updated to use the fixed components)

## Fix Approach

The fix follows the same approach successfully applied to the ROM component:

1. **Keep UI Structural Components**: 
   - Maintain Accordion, Card, Tabs, and other UI structural components
   - Preserve the visual organization and user experience

2. **Replace Form UI Components with Native HTML**:
   - Replace `FormField`, `FormItem`, etc. with native HTML form elements
   - Use direct form context methods like `setValue` and `watch` instead of UI components
   - Native elements include `<select>`, `<input type="checkbox">`, `<textarea>`, etc.

3. **Preserve Data Structure**:
   - Keep the same form data path structure (e.g., `data.manualMuscle.shoulder.flexion.right`)
   - Ensure form values are properly updated in the form context
   - Maintain all validation and data processing logic

## Error Details

The error messages in the console showed:

```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

These errors were occurring in the ManualMuscle component and other components that were using the FormField component from the UI library.

## Implementation Details

### ManualMuscle.fixed.tsx
- Replaced FormField components with native HTML inputs and selects
- Maintained the same UI organization with muscleGroups and muscle items
- Used direct form context methods (watch, setValue) to manage form state

### BergBalance.fixed.tsx
- Preserved the Card-based UI structure for the 14 Berg Balance items
- Replaced form UI components with native HTML elements
- Maintained the dynamic score calculation and risk assessment

### PosturalTolerances.fixed.tsx
- Kept the Card-based category organization
- Replaced FormField components with native HTML elements
- Preserved the same grouping of postures (static, dynamic, transitions)

### TransfersAssessment.fixed.tsx
- Maintained the same card-based UI structure
- Replaced form UI components with HTML equivalents
- Kept all the transfer categories and data structure

### FunctionalStatus.integrated.fixed.tsx
- Updated imports to use the fixed component versions
- Fixed optional chaining in helper functions to prevent errors
- Maintained all the existing data mapping and form submission logic

## Using the Fixed Components

To use the fixed components:

1. Update the imports in any file that uses these components:

```typescript
// Before
import { ManualMuscle } from './ManualMuscle';
import { BergBalance } from './BergBalance';
// ...

// After
import { ManualMuscle } from './ManualMuscle.fixed';
import { BergBalance } from './BergBalance.fixed';
// ...
```

2. Use the main integrated component:

```typescript
// Before
import { FunctionalStatusIntegrated } from './FunctionalStatus.integrated';

// After
import { FunctionalStatusIntegrated } from './FunctionalStatus.integrated.fixed';
```

## Benefits of this Approach

1. **Immediate Error Resolution**: Fixes the undefined component errors
2. **Minimal Visual Changes**: Maintains the same UI structure and appearance
3. **Same Data Model**: Uses the same data structure for consistency
4. **Compatibility**: Works with the existing form validation and submission logic
5. **Gradual Transition**: Can be gradually applied to other sections with similar issues

## Future Considerations

As a longer-term solution, consider:

1. Reviewing the form component library implementation to identify root causes
2. Standardizing on a specific approach for form components across the application
3. Creating a more robust FormField component that can handle various input types
4. Implementing better error boundaries around form sections

## Reference

This fix is based on the successful approach used in the ROM component, which demonstrated that the Accordion components from the UI library work correctly while the form components were causing issues.
