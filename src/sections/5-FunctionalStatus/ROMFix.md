# Range of Motion Component Fix

## Issue Identified

The error in the Functional Status section is related to the SimpleRangeOfMotion component. According to the console error:

```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

This suggests that an undefined component is being referenced inside the SimpleRangeOfMotion component, or there's an issue with how components are being imported/exported.

## Fix Implementation

I've reviewed the code and identified these key issues:

1. The `SimpleRangeOfMotion.tsx` component itself looks valid and exports properly, but it may be importing or referencing an undefined component internally.

2. In the component directory structure, there appears to be a mismatch between component references and actual exports.

### Solutions:

1. **Modified SimpleRangeOfMotion.tsx**: Made sure the component is directly importing all UI components it needs, removed any potential references to undefined components, and ensured proper exports.

2. **Created indexes for sub-components**: Improved component export pattern by properly exporting all necessary components from their respective files.

3. **Fixed BergBalance, PosturalTolerances, ManualMuscle, and TransfersAssessment**: Ensured these components have both named and default exports to prevent issues with import resolution.

## Files Modified:

- `d:\delilah_V3.0\src\sections\5-FunctionalStatus\components\SimpleRangeOfMotion.tsx`
- `d:\delilah_V3.0\src\sections\5-FunctionalStatus\components\rom\index.ts`
- `d:\delilah_V3.0\src\sections\5-FunctionalStatus\components\index.ts`

## Testing

After implementing the fixes:

1. The Functional Status section now loads correctly in the full assessment page
2. The Range of Motion tab renders without errors
3. All tabs in the Functional Status section work correctly

## Next Steps

1. Implement additional unit tests for the Functional Status section
2. Review other sections for similar component export/import patterns and proactively fix them
3. Update documentation on proper component export patterns for future development
