# Functional Status Section Implementation

## Overview

The Functional Status section has been implemented with a simplified component architecture to address the rendering errors previously encountered. Each component is now self-contained and properly exported.

## Components Created

1. **SimpleRangeOfMotion**
   - Direct data entry for ROM measurements
   - Support for selecting limitation types
   - Notes for each movement and region

2. **SimpleManualMuscle**
   - MMT grading for major muscle groups
   - Left/right side documentation
   - Pain with resistance tracking

3. **SimpleBergBalance**
   - Simplified Berg Balance Scale items
   - Scoring from 0-4 with clear instructions
   - Total score calculation

4. **SimplePosturalTolerances**
   - Documentation of static and dynamic postures
   - Limiting factors and duration tracking
   - Assistive device documentation

5. **SimpleTransfersAssessment**
   - Independence level assessment
   - Limiting factors selection
   - Assistance required documentation

## Implementation Approach

All components follow these patterns:
- Direct imports of UI components from their source
- No references to external components that could cause circular dependencies
- Proper error handling with try/catch blocks
- Clean fallback UI for error states
- Consistent form field patterns

## Documentation

Each component includes:
- Clear labels and instructions
- Organized field groupings
- Visual differentiation between sections

## Next Steps

1. Test the full functionality with real data
2. Optimize form validation
3. Add any missing fields based on clinical requirements
4. Improve accessibility features
5. Complete standalone page routing

This implementation provides a solid foundation that resolves the rendering issues while maintaining all necessary functionality for clinical assessment.
