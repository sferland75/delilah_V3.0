# Functional Status Component Fix - Issue Resolution

## Issue Identified
The error was occurring in the Functional Status section due to export/import issues with components. The main error was:

```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

The console error specifically pointed to the SimpleRangeOfMotion component.

## Root Cause
1. Multiple default exports causing conflicts in the component index file
2. Ambiguous component references due to mixed import patterns
3. Possible circular dependencies between components

## Solution Applied
1. Simplified the component exports in `index.ts` to use only named exports (avoiding multiple default exports)
2. Updated all component files to have consistent export patterns with both named and default exports
3. Modified `SimpleFunctionalStatus.tsx` to directly import specific components from their respective files rather than using the aggregated index

### Files Modified
1. `src/sections/5-FunctionalStatus/components/index.ts`: Removed duplicate default exports
2. `src/sections/5-FunctionalStatus/components/SimpleRangeOfMotion.tsx`: Ensured proper exports
3. `src/sections/5-FunctionalStatus/components/ROMAssessment.tsx`: Added proper default export
4. `src/sections/5-FunctionalStatus/SimpleFunctionalStatus.tsx`: Updated imports to use direct references

## Testing
The changes resolve the undefined component error. The Functional Status section now loads and displays all its sub-components properly.

## Prevention Measures
1. Maintain consistent export patterns in components:
   - Use named exports as primary method (`export function ComponentName`)
   - Add a default export for flexibility (`export default ComponentName`)
   
2. Organize component directories properly:
   - Use index files to export components from their directories
   - Avoid circular references between components
   - Use direct imports when appropriate
   
3. Implement testing for component loading:
   - Test that each component can be imported and rendered independently
   - Test integration of components in parent contexts
   - Add error boundaries to isolate component failures

## Best Practices for Future Development
When adding new components to the Functional Status section (or other sections), follow these patterns:

1. Use named exports as the primary export pattern
2. Ensure all component files have consistent export patterns
3. Use direct imports for complex component relationships
4. Add error boundaries and fallbacks at appropriate levels
5. Test components in isolation and integration contexts
