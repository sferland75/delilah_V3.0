# ROM Component Implementation

## Issue Identified

The original ROM component had issues with the UI form components, causing an "undefined component" error. Through debugging, we determined that the Accordion components were working correctly, but the UI form components were problematic.

## Solution

1. Created a hybrid implementation that:
   - Uses Accordion components from the UI library
   - Uses native HTML form controls instead of UI form components
   - Maintains the same visual structure and data model

2. This approach preserves all functionality while avoiding the component errors:
   - The accordion UI for better organization
   - Dropdown selectors with percentage ranges
   - Checkboxes for pain and weakness
   - Textarea fields for notes
   - Full data integration with the form context

## Benefits

1. **Functionality**: All original capabilities are maintained
2. **Visual Organization**: Accordion-based structure is preserved
3. **Data Compatibility**: Same data structure for backend integration
4. **Error-Free**: No component rendering errors
5. **Future Enhancement**: Can be gradually evolved with more UI components if needed

## Technical Details

- Uses `useFormContext` hook for form integration
- Directly accesses form methods like `setValue` and `watch`
- Uses a consistent data path format: `data.rangeOfMotion.{region}.{movement}.{property}`
- Works with all standard form operations (save, reset, etc.)

## Next Steps

- Apply similar pattern to fix nested form issues in other components
- Consider implementing a more robust UI component library
- If needed, gradually reintroduce UI form components with proper debugging
