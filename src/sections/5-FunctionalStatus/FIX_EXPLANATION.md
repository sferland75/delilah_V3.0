# Functional Status Component Fix - Emergency Resolution

## Issue Identified
The error in the Functional Status section was an undefined component in SimpleRangeOfMotion.tsx:

```
Error: Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

Looking at line 224 in SimpleRangeOfMotion.tsx and the component structure, we found that there was an undefined component being referenced that could not be resolved during rendering.

## Emergency Fix Approach

Rather than trying to fix all the interdependent components at once, we implemented a temporary emergency fix:

1. Created a `SimpleFallback.tsx` component as a fallback UI for the Range of Motion section
2. Modified `SimpleFunctionalStatus.tsx` to use simple fallback components instead of the complex components with dependencies
3. Added an alert to inform users that maintenance is in progress

This approach ensures that:
1. The app can load without crashing
2. Users get appropriate feedback
3. Other sections of the application continue to function normally

## Root Cause Analysis

After reviewing the code, we identified several underlying issues:

1. **Circular Component References**: The components had circular dependencies that resulted in undefined references
2. **Mixed Import Patterns**: Inconsistent use of named vs default exports caused confusion
3. **Missing Component Exports**: Some components were not properly exported

## Long-Term Fix (To Be Implemented)

The full fix will involve:

1. Restructuring all component exports to use a consistent pattern
2. Breaking circular dependencies by refactoring components
3. Adding proper error boundaries at each component level
4. Implementing a systematic testing approach for component loading

## Testing the Fix

The emergency fix should:
1. Allow the full assessment page to load
2. Show appropriate fallback UI for functional status sections
3. Preserve data entry in other sections

## Next Steps

1. Implement proper component structure for SimpleRangeOfMotion
2. Fix each sub-component one by one
3. Apply consistent export patterns
4. Add thorough testing

## Developer Notes

If you need to make additional changes:
1. Modify the FallbackComponent to show more detailed messages
2. Update the SimpleFunctionalStatus to gradually incorporate fixed components
3. Run targeted tests after each component fix

This emergency fix provides a working application while a more comprehensive solution is developed.
