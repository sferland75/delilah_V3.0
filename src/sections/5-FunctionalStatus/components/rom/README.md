# Range of Motion (ROM) Assessment Module

## Overview
The Range of Motion (ROM) module provides a simplified approach to documenting joint movement limitations. This redesigned system uses an accordion-based interface with standardized movement patterns and clear range estimations.

## Key Features

### 1. Simplified Range Categories
- **Within Normal Limits (90-100%)**: Normal/full range of motion
- **Mild Restriction (70-85%)**: Slight limitation with minimal functional impact
- **Moderate Restriction (40-65%)**: Noticeable limitation with some functional impact
- **Severe Restriction (15-35%)**: Significant limitation with major functional impact
- **Minimal Movement (0-10%)**: Extreme limitation with severe functional impact

### 2. Streamlined Joint Groupings
- **Cervical Spine**: Core neck movements
- **Thoracolumbar Spine**: Core back movements
- **Upper Extremity**: Essential shoulder, elbow and wrist movements
- **Lower Extremity**: Essential hip, knee and ankle movements

### 3. Consolidated Movement Patterns
Each joint region uses combined movement patterns to simplify assessment:
- Bilateral movements are combined (L/R noted together)
- Only clinically significant movements are included
- Related movements are grouped logically

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Use
- Initial musculoskeletal assessments
- Progress monitoring during treatment
- Functional evaluations
- Discharge assessments

### Documentation Best Practices
1. Complete related joint regions when a limitation is identified
2. Document pain limitations and weakness where present
3. Add specific notes for any unusual findings
4. Provide context in general notes section

### Clinical Considerations
- Ranges are clinical estimates only, not goniometric measurements
- Assessment is designed for functional documentation, not research precision
- Dropdown values should be considered approximate ranges
- Documentation focuses on functional limitations rather than exact measurements
