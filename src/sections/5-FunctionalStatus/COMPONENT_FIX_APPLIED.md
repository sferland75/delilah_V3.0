# Functional Status Component Fix

## Issue Fixed

Fixed an error in the `SimpleRangeOfMotion` component where React was encountering an undefined component. The error message was:

```
Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined. You likely forgot to export your component from the file it's defined in, or you might have mixed up default and named imports.
```

## Solution Implementation

### 1. Component Export Structure

Created a standardized component export pattern for the Functional Status section:

- Added proper `index.ts` files to ensure components are exported correctly
- Added both named and default exports for each component to support different import patterns
- Reorganized imports in the `SimpleFunctionalStatus` component to use the centralized exports

### 2. Component Index Files

Created/updated the following index files:
- `components/index.ts`: Exports all sub-components with both named and default exports
- `components/rom/index.ts`: Exports ROM-specific components and utilities

### 3. Import Resolution in Parent Components

Modified the main `SimpleFunctionalStatus` component to import from the centralized `components` export rather than individual files.

### 4. Component Verification

Verified that each component implements both named and default exports:
- SimpleRangeOfMotion
- ManualMuscle
- BergBalance
- PosturalTolerances
- TransfersAssessment

## Files Modified

1. `src/sections/5-FunctionalStatus/components/index.ts` (new file)
2. `src/sections/5-FunctionalStatus/components/rom/index.ts` (new file)
3. `src/sections/5-FunctionalStatus/SimpleFunctionalStatus.tsx` (updated imports)

## Testing Steps

To verify the fix:
1. Navigate to the full assessment page
2. Go to the Functional Status tab
3. Verify that the Range of Motion sub-tab loads correctly
4. Test each sub-tab in the Functional Status section

## Future Prevention

To prevent similar issues:
1. Always use centralized export patterns through index files
2. Implement both named and default exports for each component
3. Use TypeScript for better type checking
4. Add unit tests for components to catch import/export issues early
