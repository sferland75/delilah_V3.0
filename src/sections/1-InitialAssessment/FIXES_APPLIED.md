# Demographics Section Fixes Applied

## Overview

The Demographics section has been refactored following the standardized patterns for routing and component structure defined in the implementation guidelines.

## Key Improvements

1. **Component Structure**
   - Created simplified component (`SimpleDemographics.tsx`)
   - Added integration component for assessment flow (`DemographicsSection.tsx`)
   - Maintained original complex component for backward compatibility

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added error boundaries at multiple levels
   - Implemented fallback components
   - Added proper loading states

3. **Data Flow**
   - Standardized context integration
   - Improved form state management
   - Added proper feedback via toast notifications

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Consistent tab-based layout
   - Responsive form design
   - Clear user feedback on actions

5. **Form Validation**
   - Integrated Zod schema validation
   - Consistent field error handling
   - Improved data type management

## Implementation Pattern

1. The component follows the modular pattern:
   - `schema.ts`: Contains Zod schema and type definitions
   - `SimpleDemographics.tsx`: Basic implementation with minimal dependencies
   - `DemographicsSection.tsx`: Integration component with error handling
   - `index.ts`: Standardized exports

2. The route implementation uses:
   - Standalone page at `/demographics`
   - Integration in full assessment flow
   - Error boundaries with fallbacks

## Testing Strategy

1. Component can be tested in isolation via `/demographics` route
2. Component can be tested in integration via `/full-assessment` route
3. Error handling can be tested by temporarily modifying imports

## Implementation Notes

1. Form data is automatically synced with the assessment context
2. The UI is responsive across different screen sizes
3. Added fallback mechanisms if the component fails to load

## Future Improvements

1. Add unit tests for component and validation
2. Enhance field validation with real-time feedback
3. Add address validation and auto-completion
