# Symptoms Assessment Section Fixes Applied

## Overview

The Symptoms Assessment section has been refactored to follow the standardized patterns for routing and component structure outlined in the implementation fixes documentation.

## Key Improvements

1. **Component Structure**
   - Created simplified component (`SimpleSymptomsAssessment.tsx`)
   - Added integration component for assessment flow (`SymptomsAssessmentSection.tsx`)
   - Maintained original complex component for backward compatibility

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added error boundaries at multiple levels
   - Implemented fallback components
   - Added proper loading states

3. **Data Flow**
   - Standardized context integration
   - Improved form state management
   - Added toast notifications for save operations

4. **UI Improvements**
   - Tab-based navigation for better content organization
   - Responsive layout for different screen sizes
   - Clear visual hierarchy

5. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Reduced component complexity
   - Improved loading states
   - Direct imports for key dependencies

## Implementation Pattern

1. The component follows the modular pattern:
   - `schema.updated.ts`: Contains Zod schema and type definitions
   - `SimpleSymptomsAssessment.tsx`: Basic implementation with minimal dependencies
   - `SymptomsAssessmentSection.tsx`: Integration component with error handling
   - `index.ts`: Standardized exports

2. The route implementation uses:
   - Standalone page at `/symptoms-assessment`
   - Integration in full assessment flow
   - Error boundaries with fallbacks

## Testing Strategy

1. Component can be tested in isolation via `/symptoms-assessment` route
2. Component can be tested in integration via `/full-assessment` route
3. Error handling can be tested by temporarily modifying imports

## Implementation Notes

1. Symptom selection is organized by category for better UX
2. Pain rating uses a slider with visual feedback
3. Added fallback mechanisms if the component fails to load

## Future Improvements

1. Add unit tests for component and validation
2. Add symptom categorization tags
3. Implement symptom severity tracking over time
