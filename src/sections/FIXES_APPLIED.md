# Applied Fixes for Data Loading Issues

## Overview
This document summarizes the fixes that were applied to resolve data loading issues in the Medical History, Symptoms Assessment, and Typical Day sections. These sections were not properly populating data when using the Load Assessment functionality.

## Common Issues Found

1. **State Updates During Rendering**: 
   - All components were attempting to update state (`setDataLoaded`) during the rendering process, which caused React to throw "Too many re-renders" errors
   - This is a critical React anti-pattern that was causing the components to enter infinite re-render loops

2. **Improper Data Structure Handling**:
   - Some components were not properly handling nested data structures from the Assessment Context
   - Missing error boundaries for specific data paths

3. **Inefficient State Management**:
   - Default values were being calculated during each render rather than memoized
   - Multiple state updates were triggering unnecessarily

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Medical History Fixes (`MedicalHistory.integrated.final.tsx`)

- Moved data mapping logic to `useCallback` hook to prevent recreating function on every render
- Fixed state update by moving `setDataLoaded` to the `useEffect` hook instead of during render
- Improved structure of the return value to include both form data and a flag indicating if data was found
- Set form's `defaultValues` to a static value, then used `form.reset()` in `useEffect` to update values when needed
- Added better error handling with more granular try/catch blocks

### 2. Symptoms Assessment Fixes (`SymptomsAssessment.integrated.final.tsx`)

- Fixed the critical "Too many re-renders" error by moving state update to `useEffect`
- Modified the mapping function to return both the form data and a hasData flag
- Improved emotional symptoms mapping to handle multiple data formats
- Added proper error handling for each mapping operation
- Fixed form initialization to prevent state update during render

### 3. Typical Day Fixes (`TypicalDay.integrated.final.tsx`)

- Refactored context data mapping to use `useCallback` hook
- Fixed the return structure to include both form data and data flag
- Moved state update to `useEffect` hook
- Improved text-to-activity conversion for better handling of different text formats
- Fixed form initialization to use static default values

## Technical Details

The key pattern used across all components is:

```tsx
// 1. Define form with static default values
const form = useForm({
  defaultValues: defaultFormState  // NOT computed during render
});

// 2. Memoize mapping function with useCallback
const mapContextDataToForm = useCallback(() => {
  // Convert context data to form structure
  return { formData, hasData };
}, [contextData]);

// 3. Use useEffect for form updates and state changes
useEffect(() => {
  if (contextData) {
    const { formData, hasData } = mapContextDataToForm();
    form.reset(formData);  // Update form AFTER render
    setDataLoaded(hasData);  // Update state AFTER render
  }
}, [contextData, mapContextDataToForm, form]);
```

This pattern ensures React's rendering cycle remains intact and prevents infinite re-render loops.

## Verification

These fixes have been tested with the sample data provided in the LoadAssessment component, and all three sections now correctly populate with data when loaded.

## Next Steps

1. Apply similar fixes to any other components that might exhibit the same issues
2. Create comprehensive tests for data loading and mapping
3. Consider adding centralized error handling for context mapping operations
