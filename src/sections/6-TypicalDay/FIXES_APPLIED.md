# Typical Day Section Fixes Applied

## Overview

The Typical Day section has been completely refactored to address the issues outlined in the implementation fixes summary. The section now follows the standardized patterns for routing and component structure.

## Key Improvements

1. **Schema Standardization**
   - Created unified schema with Zod validation
   - Added support for both regular and irregular sleep schedules
   - Standardized form state initialization

2. **Component Structure**
   - Created simplified component (`SimpleTypicalDay.tsx`)
   - Created enhanced component with full functionality (`EnhancedTypicalDay.tsx`)
   - Added proper integration component for assessment flow (`TypicalDaySection.tsx`)

3. **Error Handling**
   - Added error boundaries at multiple levels
   - Implemented fallback components
   - Added toast notifications for user feedback

4. **Data Flow**
   - Standardized context integration
   - Improved data mapping between text and structured formats
   - Fixed nested structure issues in context data

5. **User Experience**
   - Replaced browser alerts with toast notifications
   - Added proper loading states
   - Improved UI with standardized components

## Implementation Pattern

1. The component follows the modular pattern:
   - `schema.updated.ts`: Contains Zod schema and type definitions
   - `SimpleTypicalDay.tsx`: Basic implementation with minimal dependencies
   - `EnhancedTypicalDay.tsx`: Full-featured implementation
   - `TypicalDaySection.tsx`: Integration component with error handling
   - `index.ts`: Standardized exports

2. The route implementation uses:
   - Dynamic imports with fallbacks
   - Error boundaries
   - Consistent navigation pattern

## Testing Strategy

1. Component can be tested in isolation via `/typical-day` route
2. Component can be tested in integration via `/full-assessment` route
3. Error handling can be tested by temporarily modifying imports
   
## Implementation Notes

1. The component now properly saves and loads sleep schedule data
2. The UI adapts based on sleep schedule type (regular vs irregular)
3. Added fallback mechanisms if the enhanced component fails to load

## Future Improvements

1. Add unit tests for the component and schema validation
2. Add data transformation logging for debugging
3. Improve form validation error messages
