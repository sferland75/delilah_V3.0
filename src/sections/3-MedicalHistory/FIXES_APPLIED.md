# Medical History Section Fixes Applied

## Overview

The Medical History section has been refactored to follow the standardized patterns for routing and component structure defined in the implementation guidelines.

## Key Improvements

1. **Component Structure**
   - Created simplified component (`SimpleMedicalHistory.tsx`)
   - Added integration component with error handling (`MedicalHistorySection.tsx`)
   - Maintained compatibility with the original component structure

2. **Error Handling**
   - Added error boundaries at multiple levels
   - Implemented fallback components
   - Added proper loading state handling

3. **Data Flow**
   - Standardized context integration
   - Used form arrays for dynamic data
   - Added proper validation feedback
   - Implemented toast notifications

4. **User Experience**
   - Tab-based organization of multiple sections
   - Improved add/remove controls for dynamic fields
   - Clear input validation feedback

## Implementation Pattern

1. The component follows the modular pattern:
   - `schema.ts`: Contains Zod schema and type definitions
   - `SimpleMedicalHistory.tsx`: Implementation with error handling and loading states
   - `MedicalHistorySection.tsx`: Integration component 
   - `index.tsx`: Standardized exports

2. The route implementation uses:
   - Standalone page at `/medical-history`
   - Integration in full assessment flow
   - Consistent error boundaries

## Testing Strategy

1. Component can be tested in isolation via `/medical-history` route
2. Component can be tested in integration via `/full-assessment` route
3. Form validation can be tested by submitting incomplete data

## Future Improvements

1. Add confirmation modals for deletion operations
2. Implement section-specific validations (e.g., date ranges, medication interactions)
3. Add unit tests for component and validation logic
4. Add support for medication history vs current medications
