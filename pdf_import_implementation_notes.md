# PDF Import Feature Implementation Notes

## Completed (February 28, 2025)

### Core PDF Text Extraction
- Implemented PDF text extraction using pdf.js library
- Created robust extraction with formatting preservation
- Added text normalization options
- Implemented page-by-page extraction for better organization
- Created utility functions for extracting common patterns (lists, severity, impacts, activities, assistance needs)

### Pattern Matchers
- Created a modular pattern matcher architecture
- Implemented demographics pattern matcher
- Implemented medical history pattern matcher
- Implemented purpose & methodology pattern matcher
- Added confidence scoring for all matchers

### Structure and Organization
- Separated concerns into multiple files for maintainability
- Created interfaces for consistent type definitions
- Provided utility functions for common extraction needs
- Implemented testing for extraction utilities

## Next Steps

### Remaining Pattern Matchers
- Complete symptoms pattern matcher
- Complete functional status pattern matcher
- Complete typical day pattern matcher
- Complete environmental assessment pattern matcher
- Complete activities of daily living pattern matcher
- Complete attendant care pattern matcher

### Further Enhancements
- Add section detection algorithm improvement for better accuracy
- Implement table data extraction for structured information
- Add contextual validation of extracted data
- Create PDF preview functionality in the UI
- Add side-by-side comparison of extracted vs. original content

### Documentation
- Create user guide for PDF import feature
- Add notes on supported PDF formats
- Document confidence score meaning and thresholds
- Provide guidance on how to prepare PDFs for optimal extraction

## Architecture Notes

The PDF import feature uses a modular approach with the following components:

1. **PDF Processing Service**: Main entry point for processing PDFs, coordinates extraction and matching
2. **PDF Extraction**: Core text extraction using PDF.js with formatting preservation
3. **Pattern Matchers**: Individual matchers for different sections with specialized extraction logic
4. **UI Components**: User interface for uploading, previewing, and confirming extracted data

This approach allows for:
- Independent development and testing of each matcher
- Easy addition of new matchers without changing core code
- Precise confidence scoring for better data quality assessment
- Clear separation of extraction logic from UI concerns

## Testing Strategy

Testing for this feature includes:
1. Unit tests for extraction utilities
2. Unit tests for individual pattern matchers
3. Integration tests for the full extraction pipeline
4. UI component tests for the PDF import interface
5. End-to-end tests for complete PDF processing workflow

## Next Developer Tasks

1. Implement the remaining pattern matchers following the established architecture
2. Update the UI to show confidence scores with appropriate visual cues
3. Add documentation for the PDF import feature in user guides
4. Create more comprehensive tests with real-world PDF examples
