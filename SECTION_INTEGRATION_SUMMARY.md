### 7. Attendant Care
- **Components**: AttendantCareSectionIntegrated
- **Routes**: `/attendant-care`, integrated in `/full-assessment`
- **Key Features**: Multi-level care assessment, cost calculations, summary reporting

## Implementation Pattern

Each section follows a consistent implementation pattern:

1. **Core Component**:
   - Self-contained with minimal dependencies
   - Direct context integration
   - Error handling and loading states
   - Toast notifications for user feedback

2. **Integration Component**:
   - Wraps core component in error boundary
   - Provides fallback UI if component fails
   - Implements dynamic imports where needed

3. **Standalone Page**:
   - Dedicated route for direct access
   - Consistent navigation to related sections
   - Info alerts highlighting updates/changes

4. **Assessment Flow Integration**:
   - Sidebar navigation (left-aligned)
   - Consistent error handling
   - Section state preservation

## Error Handling Strategy

All implemented sections use a multi-layered error handling approach:

1. **Component-Level Boundaries**:
   - Each component has internal error handling
   - Loading states prevent premature rendering

2. **Section-Level Boundaries**:
   - Each section is wrapped in an error boundary
   - Custom fallback UI maintains user experience

3. **Page-Level Boundaries**:
   - Full assessment page has top-level error handling
   - Dynamic imports with fallbacks

## Data Flow

The assessment data flows through the application following a consistent pattern:

1. **Loading**:
   - Data loads from AssessmentContext
   - Transformation to form-friendly format
   - Setting initial state with defaults

2. **Editing**:
   - Form state managed by React Hook Form
   - Validation through Zod schemas
   - Real-time feedback via form state

3. **Saving**:
   - Transformation back to context format
   - Context update via updateSection
   - Explicit save via saveCurrentAssessment
   - User feedback via toast notifications

## UI Improvements

1. **Unified Layout**:
   - Left sidebar navigation on full assessment
   - Consistent card-based content areas
   - Standardized spacing and padding

2. **Responsive Design**:
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Grid layouts that adapt to screen sizes
   - Accessible form controls

## Section Implementation Approaches

### Simplified vs. Full Components

The application uses two approaches to component implementation:

1. **Simplified Components** (Demographics, Medical History, Symptoms, Functional Status, Activities of Daily Living):
   - Focused on core functionality with minimal dependencies
   - Straightforward state management
   - Prioritizes reliability and error resilience

2. **Full-Featured Components** (Attendant Care):
   - Comprehensive functionality with advanced features
   - Complex state management and calculations
   - Enhanced user experience with detailed interactions

Both approaches follow the same integration patterns and error handling strategies, ensuring a consistent user experience across the application.

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Summary Section**:
   - Implement Assessment Summary section
   - Add report generation capabilities
   - Create executive summary view

2. **Add Comprehensive Testing**:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for full assessment flow
   - Schema validation tests

3. **Enhance User Experience**:
   - State preservation between section navigation
   - Auto-save functionality
   - Progress tracking

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Reduce bundle size
   - Implement code splitting
   - Optimize form rendering
