## Current Limitations & Known Issues

1. **Data Persistence**
   - Auto-save is not yet implemented
   - Large assessments may hit storage limits

2. **Performance**
   - Complex sections may experience rendering delays
   - Bundle size optimization needed

3. **Form Validation**
   - Cross-section validation not implemented
   - Some fields lack comprehensive validation

4. **User Experience**
   - Progress tracking not implemented
   - Limited user feedback for errors

## Next Steps

The project is now focused on preparing for field trials with the following priorities:

1. Implement robust data persistence with auto-save
2. Enhance form validation and error feedback
3. Optimize performance for large assessments
4. Improve user experience with progress tracking
5. Add field trial support features (feedback, analytics)
