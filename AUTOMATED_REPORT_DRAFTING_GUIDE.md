## Overview

Delilah V3.0's Automated Report Drafting System uses advanced natural language processing to generate comprehensive assessment reports based on data collected through the application. This guide explains how the system works, how to use it effectively, and how to customize its outputs.

## Key Features

1. **Data-Driven Content Generation**: Creates detailed, professional reports based on assessment data
2. **Intelligent Content Suggestions**: Offers recommendations for additional content and findings
3. **Contextual Analysis**: Identifies patterns and relationships across assessment sections
4. **Customizable Templates**: Supports organization-specific formatting and structure
5. **Interactive Editing**: Allows for refinement and customization of generated content

## Report Generation Workflow

### 1. Data Aggregation and Analysis

The system begins by aggregating data from all completed assessment sections:

```
┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐
│  Demographics   │     │ Medical History │     │    Symptoms     │
└────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘     └────────┬────────┘
         │                       │                       │
         v                       v                       v
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     Data Aggregation Layer                     │
└───────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                                │
                                v
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Contextual Analysis Engine                  │
└───────────────────────────────┬───────────────────────────────┘
                                │
                                v
┌───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  Narrative Structure Generator                 │
└───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

This phase includes:

- Filtering relevant data points from each assessment section
- Analyzing relationships between symptoms, history, and functional limitations
- Identifying key patterns and significant findings
- Determining report structure based on available data

### 2. Narrative Generation

The system then creates natural language narratives for each report section:

```typescript
// Example narrative generation for symptoms section
function generateSymptomsNarrative(data) {
  const { physical, cognitive, emotional } = data.symptoms;
  
  // Generate physical symptoms narrative
  let physicalNarrative = '';
  if (physical && physical.length > 0) {
    physicalNarrative = `The client reports ${physical.length} physical symptoms, ` +
      `primarily affecting the ${getMostAffectedAreas(physical)}. ` +
      `${getSymptomSeverityDescription(physical)} ` +
      `${getSymptomDurationDescription(physical)}`;
  }
  
  // Generate cognitive symptoms narrative
  // ...
  
  // Combine narratives with intelligent transitions
  return combineNarrativesWithTransitions([
    physicalNarrative,
    cognitiveNarrative,
    emotionalNarrative
  ]);
}
```

### 3. Report Assembly

The system assembles the complete report using a customizable template:

```typescript
// Example report assembly
function assembleReport(data, narratives, template) {
  const sections = template.sections.map(section => {
    // Get the appropriate narrative for this section
    const narrative = narratives[section.id] || '';
    
    // Apply section-specific formatting
    const formattedContent = applyFormatting(narrative, section.formatting);
    
    // Create section with title and content
    return {
      id: section.id,
      title: section.title,
      content: formattedContent,
      subsections: section.subsections?.map(subsection => {
        // Process subsections similarly
        // ...
      })
    };
  });
  
  // Assemble full report
  return {
    title: template.title,
    author: data.assessor.name,
    date: new Date().toISOString(),
    client: `${data.demographics.firstName} ${data.demographics.lastName}`,
    sections,
    appendices: generateAppendices(data, template)
  };
}
```

### 4. User Review and Refinement

The system presents the generated report for review, with tools for:

- Editing and refining generated content

- **Treatment History**: Incorporates response to previous treatments
- **Client Goals**: Aligns recommendations with stated client objectives

## Implementation in Form Components

Each form section integrates with the report drafting system through a standardized interface:

```typescript
// Example integration with form component
function SymptomsAssessmentSection() {
  // Standard form implementation
  // ...
  
  // Report drafting integration
  const { registerReportContent, updateReportContent } = useReportDrafting();
  
  // Register initial report content based on form data
  useEffect(() => {
    if (dataLoaded) {
      const reportContent = generateSymptomsReportContent(form.getValues());
      registerReportContent('symptoms', reportContent);
    }
  }, [dataLoaded, form, registerReportContent]);
  
  // Update report content when form changes
  const handleSaveAndUpdateReport = (data) => {
    // Standard save operation
    onSubmit(data);
    
    // Update report content
    const reportContent = generateSymptomsReportContent(data);
    updateReportContent('symptoms', reportContent);
  };
  
  // Form rendering
  // ...
}
```
