## Session Introduction (10 minutes)

### Welcome and Introduction:

"Hello, [Participant Name]. Thank you for participating in this usability testing session for Delilah V3.0. My name is [Facilitator Name], and I'll be guiding you through this session today.

We're testing a new version of the Delilah assessment software that includes intelligence features designed to help OTs create more complete and consistent assessment reports. Your feedback will be incredibly valuable in helping us refine these features.

This session will last approximately 90 minutes. I want to emphasize that we are testing the software, not your abilities. There are no wrong actions or answers. Your honest feedback, whether positive or negative, is exactly what we need."

### Consent and Recording:

"We'd like to record this session, including your screen actions and our conversation. This recording will only be used by our development team to improve the software. It won't be shared publicly.

Before we begin, please read and sign this consent form. Feel free to ask any questions you may have."

[Present consent form, allow time for reading and questions]

### Session Overview:

"Here's what we'll be doing today:
1. I'll start by asking a few background questions about your experience
2. You'll complete three specific tasks using the software
3. While working, please think aloud—verbalize what you're thinking, what you're looking for, and any reactions you have
4. After the tasks, we'll have a debriefing discussion and you'll complete a short questionnaire
5. Throughout the session, I'll mostly be observing, but feel free to ask questions if you get completely stuck"

## Background Questions (5-10 minutes)

"Before we start with the tasks, I'd like to learn a bit about your experience with assessment reports."

1. "How long have you been working as an occupational therapist?"
2. "How frequently do you create assessment reports in your current role?"
3. "What tools or software do you currently use for assessment documentation?"
4. "What are your biggest challenges when creating assessment reports?"
5. "Have you used any previous versions of Delilah before?"
6. "On a scale of 1-5, how comfortable are you with new technology in general?"

## Task 1: Complete a New Assessment Using Intelligence Features (30 minutes)

### Setup:

"For this first task, I'll ask you to create a new assessment for a fictional client named Alex Johnson. I'll provide you with basic information about Alex, and you'll use the system to complete various sections of the assessment.

As you work, please pay special attention to any intelligence feature suggestions that appear and consider whether they're helpful. Please think aloud as you work."

### Client Information:

"Alex Johnson is a 45-year-old individual who sustained a stroke 2 months ago affecting their right side. They're experiencing moderate mobility limitations, difficulty with fine motor skills in their right hand, and some cognitive challenges including mild memory issues. They live alone in a two-story home and want to return to their office job. They're currently using a quad cane for walking and have some bathroom safety equipment already installed."

### Task Instructions:

"Please complete the following sections of a new assessment for Alex:
1. Demographics
2. Medical History
3. Symptoms Assessment
4. Functional Status
5. Environmental Assessment

Don't worry about completing every single field—focus on providing enough information that the intelligence features can give you meaningful suggestions. As you work, please tell me what you're thinking and react to any intelligence features you encounter."

### Observer Notes:

- Note which intelligence features the participant notices and uses
- Record any confusion or hesitation points
- Track how many suggestions are followed vs. ignored
- Note comments about the usefulness of suggestions
- Time how long each section takes to complete

## Task 2: Review and Improve an Existing Assessment (20 minutes)

### Setup:

"For this next task, I'll show you a partially completed assessment for another client, Jamie Smith. This assessment has several deliberate issues that the intelligence features should identify. Your task is to review the assessment, using the intelligence features to help identify and fix problems."

### Task Instructions:

"Please open the assessment for Jamie Smith and:
1. Review each completed section
2. Pay attention to the intelligence features' suggestions
3. Make improvements based on those suggestions
4. Note any issues you spot that weren't flagged by the intelligence features
5. As before, please think aloud as you work"

### Deliberate Issues in the Assessment:

- Medical History: Missing medication details for a listed condition
- Symptoms Assessment: Contradictory information about pain levels
- Functional Status: Upper extremity function lacks specific impacts
- Environmental Assessment: Home layout description is vague and incomplete
- Inconsistent terminology (uses both "patient" and "client" throughout)
- Several sections with low completeness scores

### Observer Notes:

- Track which issues the participant identifies with and without intelligence assistance
- Note participant reactions to the different types of intelligence features
- Record if any suggestions are confusing or unhelpful
- Note any missing suggestions that would have been helpful

## Task 3: Generate a Final Report and Evaluate Quality (15 minutes)

### Setup:

"For this final task, I'd like you to generate a final report from the assessment you just improved. Then, please review the report and evaluate its quality from a professional perspective."

### Task Instructions:

"Please:
1. Navigate to the report generation section
2. Generate a full assessment report
3. Review the final document
4. Consider whether this report meets professional standards
5. Identify any areas that still need improvement
6. Consider how the intelligence features contributed to the report quality"

### Observer Notes:

- Record participant's overall impression of report quality
- Note specific comments about how intelligence features affected the outcome
- Track any mentioned improvements for the report generation process
- Note whether the participant feels the final report is ready for submission or requires additional work

## Post-Test Debriefing (15 minutes)

### General Experience Questions:

1. "Overall, what was your experience using these new intelligence features?"
2. "Which intelligence feature did you find most helpful and why?"
3. "Which intelligence feature did you find least helpful or most confusing?"
4. "How do you think these features would impact your daily workflow?"
5. "On a scale of 1-10, how likely would you be to use this system in your practice?"

### Feature-Specific Questions:

1. "How helpful were the contextual suggestions? Were they relevant to the assessment you were creating?"
2. "Did the data validation warnings help you identify errors you might have missed?"
3. "Were the content improvement recommendations clear and useful for making your documentation more professional?"
4. "Did the section completeness indicators help you understand what was missing?"
5. "How helpful was the terminology consistency checking?"

### Comparative Assessment:

1. "Compared to your current process, how would using this system affect your report creation time?"
2. "Do you think the intelligence features would improve the quality of your reports?"
3. "What features from your current workflow are missing from this system?"

### Improvement Suggestions:

1. "What would you change about any of the intelligence features?"
2. "Is there any type of suggestion or assistance that was missing that would be helpful?"
3. "Were there any parts of the interface that were confusing or difficult to use?"
