# Form Component Fix

## Issue Fixed
The SymptomsAssessment component had nested form elements and was incorrectly passing React Hook Form properties directly to DOM elements. This was causing React warnings and validation errors in the console:

1. `<form> cannot appear as a descendant of <form>` - Nested form elements are invalid HTML
2. `React does not recognize the 'handleSubmit' prop on a DOM element` - React Hook Form properties improperly passed to DOM

## Changes Made

### In `SymptomsAssessment.integrated.final.tsx`:

**Before:**
```jsx
<Form {...form}>
  <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="w-full">
    <FormProvider {...form}>
      {/* Form content */}
    </FormProvider>
  </form>
</Form>
```

**After:**
```jsx
<FormProvider {...form}>
  <form onSubmit={form.handleSubmit(onSubmit)} className="w-full">
    {/* Form content */}
  </form>
</FormProvider>
```

## Why This Fixes the Issue

1. **Removed the nested forms**: Eliminated the `<Form>` component that was wrapping the native `<form>` element, which prevents the nested form warning.

2. **Used `FormProvider` correctly**: The `FormProvider` is now used at the correct level to provide the form context to all child components.

3. **Proper HTML structure**: The form structure is now valid HTML without nested form elements.

## Benefits

- Eliminates React warnings in the console
- Improves code quality and maintainability
- Ensures proper form behavior
- Simplifies the component structure

## Additional Notes

If similar issues appear in other form components, apply the same pattern:
1. Replace `<Form {...form}><form>...</form></Form>` with `<FormProvider {...form}><form>...</form></FormProvider>`
2. Ensure form props like `handleSubmit`, `setValue`, etc. are not passed directly to DOM elements
