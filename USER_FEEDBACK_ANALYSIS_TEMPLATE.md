# User Feedback Analysis Framework

This document provides a structured approach to gathering, documenting, and analyzing feedback from OT users during the testing of Delilah V3.0, with special focus on the new intelligence features.

## Feedback Collection Methods

### 1. Structured User Testing Sessions
- Think-aloud protocols
- Task completion observations
- Post-task interviews
- System Usability Scale (SUS) surveys

### 2. Field Testing
- Daily usage journals
- Feature usage analytics
- Regular check-in interviews
- Issue reporting forms

### 3. Focus Groups
- Guided discussions on specific features
- Comparative evaluations
- Workflow integration assessment
- Future feature prioritization

## Pain Point Categorization Framework

### 1. Usability Issues
- **Navigation Problems**: Difficulty finding features or moving between screens
- **Interface Confusion**: Unclear buttons, labels, or feedback
- **Workflow Disruption**: Features that interrupt natural work patterns
- **Performance Issues**: Slowness, lag, or unresponsiveness
- **Learning Curve**: Difficult to learn or remember how to use

### 2. Intelligence Feature Specific Issues
- **False Positives**: Incorrect or irrelevant suggestions
- **Missing Suggestions**: Failure to provide expected assistance
- **Suggestion Timing**: Suggestions appearing at unhelpful moments
- **Information Overload**: Too many suggestions overwhelming users
- **Suggestion Clarity**: Unclear what the suggestion means or why it's offered
- **Trust Issues**: Lack of confidence in the system's recommendations

### 3. Content and Functionality Gaps
- **Missing Features**: Necessary functionality not present
- **Incomplete Coverage**: Areas where intelligence doesn't provide support
- **Insufficient Detail**: Not enough information in suggestions
- **Integration Limitations**: Poor connection with other systems or workflows

### 4. Professional Practice Concerns
- **Clinical Judgment Conflicts**: Suggestions contradicting professional opinion
- **Documentation Standard Misalignment**: Not meeting professional standards
- **Regulatory Compliance Issues**: Concerns about meeting legal requirements
- **Ethical Considerations**: Concerns about appropriate use of technology

## Severity Classification

### Critical (1)
- Prevents completion of essential tasks
- Creates significant risk of documentation errors
- Fundamentally misaligns with clinical practice
- Directly impacts patient care quality
- Example: Suggestions that contradict established clinical guidelines

### Major (2)
- Significantly impedes workflow efficiency
- Causes consistent frustration
- Requires workarounds
- May lead to occasional errors
- Example: Intelligence features that consistently miss important assessments

### Moderate (3)
- Creates noticeable inefficiency
- Causes some user frustration
- Has inconsistent behavior
- Example: Suggestions that are sometimes helpful but often irrelevant

### Minor (4)
- Slight inconvenience
- Aesthetic issues
- Rare occurrences
- Example: Occasional unhelpful suggestions that are easily dismissed

## User Suggestion Evaluation Matrix

| Criterion | Weight | Questions to Consider |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| User Need | 30% | How many users requested this? How important is it to workflow? |
| Implementation Effort | 25% | How complex would this be to implement? What dependencies exist? |
| Alignment with Vision | 20% | Does this support our product vision? Does it advance intelligence capabilities? |
| Business Impact | 15% | Will this drive adoption? Will it create competitive advantage? |
| Regulatory Consideration | 10% | Are there compliance implications? Are there risk considerations? |

Score each suggestion from 1-5 on each criterion, then calculate weighted score.

## Feedback Analysis Process

### 1. Initial Documentation
- Record all feedback using the structured template
- Categorize pain points using the framework
- Assign severity ratings

### 2. Aggregation and Pattern Identification
- Combine feedback from all sources
- Identify recurring themes and patterns
- Quantify frequency of specific issues
- Map issues to specific features and workflows

### 3. Prioritization
- Score issues based on:
  - Severity
  - Frequency
  - Impact on workflow
  - Alignment with product goals
  - Implementation complexity

### 4. Solution Development
- Brainstorm potential solutions for top issues
- Evaluate solutions using suggestion matrix
- Create implementation recommendations
- Define success metrics for each solution

### 5. Validation
- Review proposed solutions with stakeholders
- Verify solutions address root causes
- Check for potential unintended consequences
- Align solutions with product roadmap
