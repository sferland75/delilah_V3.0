# CRITICAL RESTORATION PLAN - PRIORITY ALERT

## 911 CRISIS SITUATION

We are facing a critical situation where our fully developed, integrated sections are not being properly utilized. The recent changes have bypassed existing functional components, creating new implementations that do not leverage our established work.

## IMMEDIATE PROBLEM

1. **Loss of Functionality**: The current implementation is not utilizing our fully developed assessment sections.

2. **Inconsistent User Experience**: Users are seeing different interfaces depending on which routing system they use.

3. **Duplication of Development Effort**: We're creating new components that already exist in our codebase.

4. **Risk to Delivery Timeline**: Continuing this approach puts our delivery schedule at serious risk.

## RESTORATION STRATEGY

### Phase 1: Immediate Actions (CRITICAL)

1. **Stop All New Development**: Halt creation of new components immediately.

2. **Identify All Existing Sections**: Document all fully developed sections from the Pages Router.

3. **Map Routes**: Create a comprehensive mapping between Pages Router and App Router paths.

4. **Routing Adaptation**: Implement proper routing to direct users to our existing sections.

### Phase 2: Integration (URGENT)

1. **Layout Wrapper**: Create minimal wrappers that maintain the exact functionality of existing components.

2. **Navigation Restoration**: Restore the original navigation patterns to maintain user familiarity.

3. **State Management Preservation**: Ensure all existing state management continues to function.

4. **Test Full Workflows**: Verify complete assessment workflows function properly.

### Phase 3: Path Forward (HIGH PRIORITY)

1. **Incremental Migration Strategy**: Create a detailed plan for incremental migration of components only when necessary.

2. **Documentation Update**: Document all existing components and their relationships for future developers.

3. **Technical Debt Assessment**: Evaluate necessary updates without disrupting functionality.

## NEXT SESSION PRIORITIES

The next session will focus exclusively on:

1. **Restoring all developed and functional sections**
2. **Ensuring seamless navigation between all components**
3. **Preserving all existing data flow and state management**
4. **Verifying full system functionality**

## COMPONENT INVENTORY

We must identify and document all fully developed components to ensure nothing is overlooked in the restoration process. This includes:

1. All assessment section implementations
2. Form components and validation
3. State management structures
4. Data flow patterns
5. API integrations
6. Navigation systems

## CRITICAL WARNING

**DO NOT create new implementations of existing components**. We must utilize our established, tested, and functional code to maintain system integrity.

The focus is on restoration, not recreation.
