# Anthropic API Client Fix

## Issue

The application was generating the following error in the browser:

```
AnthropicError: It looks like you're running in a browser-like environment.
This is disabled by default, as it risks exposing your secret API credentials to attackers.
```

This error occurred because:
1. The Anthropic client was being initialized directly in the browser-side code
2. API keys were exposed in client-side JavaScript, creating a security risk
3. The Anthropic SDK is designed for server-side use, not browser use

## Solution Implemented

The solution follows best practices for using external APIs in Next.js applications:

1. **Server-Side API Route**:
   - Created a new API route at `/api/claude` that runs server-side
   - Moved Anthropic client initialization to this server-side code
   - Implemented proper error handling and response structure

2. **Client-Side Service**:
   - Refactored `claude.ts` to use fetch calls to our API route
   - Removed direct Anthropic client initialization
   - Maintained the same interface for easy integration

3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Removed `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix from API key to prevent client exposure
   - Updated environment variable references throughout the code

## Security Improvements

1. **API Key Protection**:
   - API key is now only used in server-side code
   - Key is no longer exposed in client-side JavaScript
   - Removed `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLAUDE_API_KEY` to prevent accidental exposure

2. **Proper Authentication**:
   - API route could be further enhanced with session validation
   - Rate limiting could be added for production use

## How to Test

1. Start the development server
2. Navigate to any page that uses the Intelligence features
3. Verify that there are no Anthropic-related errors in the console
4. Test that Claude-powered features still work correctly

## Future Improvements

1. **Request Validation**:
   - Add more comprehensive input validation to the API route
   - Implement proper authentication for API routes

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Improve error messages and client-side recovery logic
   - Add logging and monitoring for API failures

3. **Caching Strategy**:
   - Implement a more robust caching solution (Redis, etc.)
   - Add cache invalidation policies

4. **Rate Limiting**:
   - Add rate limiting to prevent API abuse
   - Implement request queueing for high-traffic scenarios
