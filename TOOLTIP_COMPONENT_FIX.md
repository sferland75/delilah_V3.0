# Tooltip Component Fix

## Issue

The application was failing to compile with the following error:

```
Uncaught Error: Module not found: Can't resolve '@/components/ui/tooltip'
```

This error occurred in the `SectionCompleteness.tsx` component which was trying to import the tooltip component that hadn't been created yet.

## Solution

1. **Created Missing Tooltip Component:**
   - Added a new tooltip component based on Radix UI's tooltip primitive
   - Implemented the component in `src/components/ui/tooltip/index.tsx`
   - Created all required exports: `Tooltip`, `TooltipContent`, `TooltipProvider`, and `TooltipTrigger`

2. **Updated UI Component Exports:**
   - Added the tooltip to the main UI component index file
   - Ensured all UI components are properly exported for easy importing

## Implementation Details

The tooltip component follows the same patterns as other UI components in the project:
- Uses Radix UI primitives as the foundation
- Implements consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
- Follows the same naming conventions as other components

## Usage

The tooltip can now be used in any component like this:

```tsx
import { 
  Tooltip, 
  TooltipContent, 
  TooltipProvider, 
  TooltipTrigger 
} from '@/components/ui/tooltip';

// Inside your component
<TooltipProvider>
  <Tooltip>
    <TooltipTrigger>Hover me</TooltipTrigger>
    <TooltipContent>
      <p>Tooltip content</p>
    </TooltipContent>
  </Tooltip>
</TooltipProvider>
```

## Dependencies

The tooltip component uses `@radix-ui/react-tooltip`, which was already included in the project dependencies.
