# Delilah V3.0 Project Status

## Current Status: March 4, 2025

The Delilah V3.0 application has been successfully enhanced with a fully functional user interface and core workflow capabilities. The focus has been on restoring the basic UI, implementing form completion with save capabilities, and developing the report drafting module.

### Completed Components

1. **Core UI Restoration**
   - ✅ Enhanced dashboard with workflow cards and quick access sections
   - ✅ Consistent navigation system with MainNavigation component
   - ✅ Assessment list page with CRUD functionality
   - ✅ Full assessment page with tabbed section interface

2. **Form Completion with Save Capabilities**
   - ✅ FormSectionBase component for consistent form behavior
   - ✅ Local storage integration for data persistence
   - ✅ Validation with Zod schema
   - ✅ State management with error handling

3. **Report Drafting Module**
   - ✅ Multi-step workflow (template selection → configure → preview → export)
   - ✅ AI-assisted content editing capabilities
   - ✅ Template system with different report styles
   - ✅ API client for future integration with external AI services

### Bug Fixes

Several critical issues have been addressed in this update:

1. Fixed infinite reload loop in the assessment loading mechanism
2. Fixed client name display in assessment list
3. Resolved PenTool component error
4. Improved error handling in Medical History component
5. Enhanced data persistence to ensure proper saving

### Pending Components

As per the prioritization decision, the PDF import functionality has been parked for future development as it's not part of the core workflow for the minimum viable product. This will be addressed in a subsequent phase.

## Next Steps

1. **Extended Testing**: Comprehensive testing of all implemented features
2. **User Documentation**: Create user guides for the available features
3. **Backend Integration**: Implement proper backend persistence instead of localStorage
4. **AI Integration**: Complete integration with external AI services for report drafting

## Technical Notes

- The application uses Next.js with a Pages Router architecture
- Data persistence is currently handled through localStorage
- The AssessmentContext provides central state management
- Form validation is handled with Zod schema validation
- Components follow a consistent structure with proper error handling

## Conclusion

The project has reached a significant milestone with the completion of the core UI, form completion, and report drafting modules. The application now provides a complete workflow from assessment creation to report generation, creating a solid foundation for further development.
