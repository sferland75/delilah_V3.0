### Prioritization Update

The development team has made a strategic decision to postpone the Editing & Collaboration Features to a future development phase. This decision allows us to focus resources on delivering the highest-value features first:

1. **Intelligence Features** will be prioritized to enhance the immediate user experience.
2. **User Testing & Refinement** will provide valuable feedback for final adjustments.
3. **Documentation & Deployment** will ensure a smooth rollout.

The postponed collaboration features will be revisited in Q3 2025 after the successful deployment of core functionality.

### Next Steps

1. **Implement Intelligence Features**
   - Build contextual suggestions system
   - Develop data validation warnings
   - Create content improvement recommendations
   - Implement section completeness indicators
   - Add terminology consistency checks

2. **Conduct User Testing & Refinement**
   - Set up usability testing with Occupational Therapists
   - Gather feedback on generated reports
   - Test with various data completeness scenarios
   - Validate against regulatory requirements
   - Document user pain points and suggestions

3. **Create User Documentation & Deployment**
   - Develop comprehensive user guides
   - Create tutorial videos
   - Write template customization guide
   - Document best practices for report generation
   - Create FAQ based on testing feedback

## Recent Highlights

### Comprehensive Mapper Service Implementation

All assessment sections now utilize the Mapper Service pattern for data transformation:

- **Separation of Concerns**: UI components focus purely on rendering while mapper services handle data transformation
- **Bidirectional Mapping**: Seamless conversion between context data and form structures
- **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling with fallback mechanisms
- **Testing**: Extensive test coverage for all mapper services
- **Performance**: Improved application performance by optimizing data flow

### Complete Test Coverage

The application now has comprehensive test coverage across all components:

- **Component Tests**: UI components have robust rendering and interaction tests
- **Integration Tests**: Assessment Context integration verified across all sections
- **Service Tests**: All mapper services have complete test coverage
- **Edge Cases**: Tests account for various data conditions and error scenarios
- **Load Assessment Tests**: Complete verification of sample case loading functionality

This testing infrastructure ensures the application's reliability and will support future development with confidence.
